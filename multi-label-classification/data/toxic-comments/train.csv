 Postwar damage 

The article currently states,

In 1956, the lower part of the painting was severely damaged when someone doused it with acid. On December 30 of that same year, Ugo Ungaza Villegas, a young Bolivian, damaged the painting by throwing a rock at it.

Can anyone perhaps elaborate on this? I mean, the dousing of the painting with acid is reported as though this is a normal thing to be done to a masterpiece and so nothing further needs to be said about it. Did someone just stroll into the Louvre with a beaker of acid and throw it onto the painting? I'd be interested to know the circumstances of this event, in particular why this was done and how it was allowed to happen. Who did it? What was the motivation? How was it repaired? etc. etc. |Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah, I didn't get far in the game. It was fun to play, but I think either it froze up on me during play, or the Playstation did...I can't remember the reason I stopped playing it. I love Short Circuit 2; the first was good, but for some reason the second had more charm...even if it was a poorer made movie. I was never big into Disney. I think my favorite as a child were The Lion King and Rescurers Down Under-maybe even The Great Mouse Detective. Too much singing for my tastes. I'll take Nightmare/Christmas over The Little Mermaid.

I just wanted folks to know more about actual real vampires not just the ones in Hollywood. For centuries real vampires have lived in secrecy and practice the faith in secret. The whole negative discussion as to why my articles should be deleted just validates and supports vampires living in secret and not sharing anything about our lifestyle or faith with the mundane public. (Thank God the rest of the world is a little more open minded and civil, than some of these disgruntled, bitter,  Wikipedians. I find myself laughing at the bitterness and hostile tone of some of these people. They should put this kind of energy into finding a cure for AIDS or ending world hunger. It is amazing that so many obviously, disgruntled, unhappy people are on Wikipedia. I guess not a lot of happy go lucky out the coffin vampires like me are on Wikipedia. Maybe more people should take up the vampire faith. Although it might not help some of these severely depressed and repressed souls. Vampires just do not have the time or energy for this kind of negative energy. I feel really sorry for all those people who have nothing better to do besides sit around and discuss why someone does or does not have a right to post something on Wikipedia. It is really sad and precious time wasted on having a nasty attitude and a closed mind. These people make me thank my lucky stars I am a proud and very happy vampire.

 In addition to the """"Revenge of the C-Students"""" dynamic I've discussed before, a big problem with WP is that administrators deliberate in secret, so their """"reasoning"""" behind a decision cannot be assessed. My block involved one admin bungle after another. The biggest bungle was the total absence of compelling evidence for the block. Others included the invocation of inconsistent standards of evidence. First the SPI was closed because (the admin said) I was not guilty beyond reasonable doubt; later I was blocked, even though no additional evidence was introduced, based on a lower standard of """"reasonable suspicion."""" Clearly, the admin didn't read the procedures for SPIs before rendering judgment.

Ekadashi, in Vedic (Vaishnava) calendar is a fasting day. This is day of Lord Hari (Vishnu), so one has to dedicate this day to Vishnu, thus one has to do more fasting, especially from crops (beans). In Vedas persons refrain from meat, eggs, flesh/blood 'food' completely, but on this day (Ekadashi) one even refrains from beans/crops like rice, as Kali (material lust) may hide there on Ekadashi day. This day Vishnu has to be satisfied and not our tongue, belly etc.

Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii occurs during the light fortnight (shukla paksha) of the extra, leap year month known as Adhika month. This Adhika month is considered to be very auspicious (adhika = best or greatest), as Vishnu appearing Himself. This month (Adhika Maasa) comes once every two (sometimes three) years, and so also this Ekadashi. Padmini Visuddha EkAdasii'' comes on Purushottam Shukla Paksh'''.

The countries were illegally annexed, and there is a considerable difference between de facto and de jure; if I steal your car and then forge the title, it may be """"my car"""" in that I drive it, register it, paint it hot pink and invite my relatives to live in it, but a Wikipedia article on the matter would probably best be entitled """"Theft of Dojarco's car.""""  The article on O.J. Simpson's murder case at Wikipedia is entitled O. J. Simpson murder case. Calculating numbers of countries is tangential to the legal aspect, as explained above  basically, most free countries that had relations renewed relations, never having recognized the legality of the forcible annexation. Many countries did not have relations prior to the occupation, because many were not sovereign back then (e.g., India was part of the British Empire, etc.  a list is available here ). I have nothing against including information on who did and who didn't recognize the annexation within the article, and the article should include information on the """"lameness"""" of continuity, too. But if you would emerge from the innards of this debate a bit  a person interested in the occupation (or even the argument that there was no occupation) would generally expect an article like this, with a title like this. It's a frequent search term. One includes denial in the Holocaust entry, and there are separate entries on Holocaust denial and even Criticism of Holocaust denial  but this does not mean that we agree with Holocaust denial, does it? The occupation of the Baltic States is not universally agreed upon, no  but not too many things are universally agreed upon. Presenting the prevailing view and serious alternate views is what an encyclopedia is supposed to do. You write: Saying Baltics were not annexed is pure nonsence and extremist POV. Nobody here said that the Baltics weren't annexed  what some here are saying is that they were illegally annexed whilst under occupation, and that is indeed the prevailing view.

Hi Tlmii.  If you wish to create an article on the above, you should try and ensure that the article meets notability guidelines, by having multiple reliable sources, independent of the subject and each other asserting the notability of the subject.

Actually, ironically, I found out that it seems the Netherlands designed their flag in the 17th century based on the blue-white-red colors of the Bourbon of France. According to the French Wikipedia it is King Henry IV of France who suggested these colors to the newly independent Netherlands. Finally, the Netherlands did not have borders with France at the time of the Revolution as the anonymous user wrote. France had borders with the Austrian Low Countries, but not with the independent Netherlands.

The original colours of the Dutch flag were orange, white and blue. King Henry V of France did not suggest to the Netherlands to use red, white and blue. The Dutch started using red because the orange colour was unstable in flag making.

HurricaneWarning Template

Greeting, My Friend,

Both """"camps"""" in this discussion have compelling arguments, and I'm not sure on which side of the dispute I'd settle if I decided to comment.  You are correct that the template in question is contra ASF, and is not something anyone would wish to see universalized by extrapolation: every WP article could merit some sort of advisory template, if one accounted for every possible precaution.  I concur also with MiraLuka, and find the wording of the template slightly paternalistic.

You have requested consultation, I think, because the arguments advanced by your respected opposites appeared insufficient and/or policy-contravening.  I do believe their arguments have great strength, despite some flaws.  Examine, for a moment, your comment:

""""If the primary purpose of the template is to aid/advise readers in a humanitarian fashion (as I think it is), then the template exists to serve goals that are, IMHO, wholly unencyclopedic and irrelevant to the project (the death of a few readersor even valuable contributorsand the concomitant bad press is likely to have only a de minimis deleterious effect on the project)""""

From the record, I see that you registered with Wikipedia in late-December 2005; as such, you may not be familiar with the facts (and the turmoil) surrounding John Seigenthaler, Sr.  In that instance, a single false assertion (albeit a very significant one) garnered for Wikipedia enormous negative press attention, and caused many observers to question the viability and basic premises of the project  a great boon for the Britannica boosters.  The lessons of that episode are numerous, but those applicable here include: 1) The smallest misplaced line of text is a potential danger; 2) Liability for a project in the public eye exists not simply in the law, but even moreso in the press.

It is a sad commentary on the state of the American public that I can easily imagine many readers relying solely on Wikipedia without thinking for themselves.  In most contexts, caveat lector; let them be undone by their ignorance.  In highly visible situations, however, where the press is likely to overextend itself in finding and pillorying any """"villian,"""" no matter how remote the causation, or how unjustified the charge, Wikipedia must take care.  This is an encyclopedia first, but also a non-profit foundation existing on donations.  As editors, we have a duty to protect the reputation of the project.

This raises a second point.  There is a rhetorical error in your comment cited above that has little to do with logic, except perhaps the logic of human psychology.  Large groups are rarely coldly analytical, a fact I find unfortunate quite often.  Nevertheless, it is a fact to which a wise persuader should adapt. """"The death of a few readers...is...a de minimis deleterious effect...""""  This sentence is likely to win one more opposition than support, even if it be logical and empirically correct.  Those who think first from emotion might well react to such sentiment with alarm.

On the precedent of Seigenthaler, I understand why your opposition is showing extraordinary caution when confronting the spectre of a possible high-visibility """"press event,"""" ie. natural disaster.  Given your rhetorical misstep, I understand also why you might fail in this argument, even if the opposition were meritless (thankfully, they are not so.)  On balance, you are probably more correct; the case is not unambiguous, though.  Policies and guidelines exist as principles to be applied by the responsible community in its decision-making fora.  Very rarely, an underdeveloped discussion will ignore these principles, in which case, review (and chastisement) are warranted.  More typically, well-meaning editors apply principles as best they can to cases where principles conflict or overlap.  This case is an example of the latter, and you should waste no worry over the result. Best wishes,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Okay, I'm going to try and explain this to you again.  There are a few points which you don't seem to be understanding, so I'm going to number them.
Infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information.  For instance, an actor's infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their IMDb profile.  These are not meant as sources or references.  They are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors.  The reason that they are included is summed up on WP:EL which states in part """"... information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content...""""  IMDb and IAFD go into a great amount of detail which we don't include.  This is why they are linked in the infobox.
IMDb, much like IAFD, cannot be used as a source for biographical information.  This is because there is little, if any, fact checking done for that information.  For instance, for my IMDb profile (yes, I have one and no, I will not share it with you since it has my real name), I could supply IMDb with a date of birth, ethnicity, and so on and claim to be me but they don't actually know that I am who I say I am.  The filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors, production companies, etc. which have had me work for them on their films.  Filmographies come to IMDb from official sources.  IAFD works much the same.  Biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average user/reader/whatever you want to call them.  Filmography info comes from the production companies.
You keep asking me for a source.  I don't have any other source than what is already supplied in the article.  If you go to Bitoni's article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox, you'll see a little number """"2"""" next to it.  That number refers to a reference in the references section of the article.  When you look there, you'll see that all the references are numbered.  Click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity.  The """"a, b, c"""" that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article.
That source is from Bitoni's publicist.  It's as credible as can be and is trusted.

There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π.

Sooner, The guild held some internal problems within their Guild Masters. Algie` argued with

Algie`'s breakers are slow and weak, while p a o l o's breakers are good enough to break an emp, and so, they are always the one whom breaks the emperiums. Algie` had the grudge for this reality, and so, he accused team p a o l o's guild to be selfish...

Sas nigel and p a o l o, being accused of something they didnt do, break their guild and form a new one, named RANDOM.

Random

As what they've named the group, they also did with the GM. Almond16, a skillful wizard then became as the Guildmaster. But unfortunately, almond16 lacks leadership and eagerness to attack an agit. His guildmates always come before him in the agit. He sometimes also shock and frighthened on what to do next, lacks command responsibility.. This again triggers for a breakup for the guild. And so, the evolution of a  new guild arises, ASHER.

ASHER

The last evolution of sas nigel's perseverance to create a guild. The guild's name is orginally derived from their first born baby, named Angelo Asher Ancheta. The baby is the source of all strength and power of the couple, and so naming for it in a guild is a good one..

Asher is composed of all star-break away guildmembers. One of it was deMonyiTa`~, [BS]Blackmith, milennia of Bad Boys, Rikku9, ...ommi..., † WardeN † of Majesty, and the rest of BANDITS members. 
This members have one thing in common, their school, except for ommi studying at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. deMonyiTa`~ is being recruited by p a o l o in an event, wherein he finds Autogame Cybershop """"home"""".

As you probably know, Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia collaboratively written entirely by volunteers. If you ever see anything that can be improved—be it correcting a typo or writing a new article—don't be afraid to fix it yourself! Don't worry about making mistakes; one of the many editors will probably notice and quickly correct it. If you have any questions, just place the text {{helpme}} on your talk page, and an administrator will help you shortly. Alternatively, you could join the #wikipedia-en-help IRC channel, where dozens of friendly helpers await. You can find out more about the project here, but I won't bore you with statistics and rules. Just remember to be civil to other editors, to always cite your sources, and to write articles from a neutral point of view, and you should be good to go.

Wikipedia is a huge website; with  articles, it is the single biggest encyclopedia in the world. Additionally, there are thousands of policy and process pages, so it can be a bit overwhelming, even to experienced users. When I was new, I found the Tutorial particularly helpful. You might also want to check out the glossary. This page serves as our library reference desk, where you can ask nearly any question imaginable.

The Featured Articles and Good Article pages are good places to look for some of our most well-written and comprehensive articles. On the other end of the spectrum, we have thousands of articles that require cleanup of some sort, so feel free to help out. In particular, many biographies of living persons need to be sourced properly; while this task can be a bit difficult, it's of a highly important nature.

 Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.
 As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that """"CITATION NEEDED"""" was not vandalism, then the next time they used """"NEED CITATION"""", or """"CITATION REQUIRED"""" or """"FACT CHECK"""", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

 Meditteraneanism? 

Does Mediterraneanism merit its own article? It seems to be a reactionary counter-Nordicist movement. One of the earliest examples I can find is in an issue of The Fascist by the Imperial Fascist League (a British-Nordicist Fascist group). In issue #65, October 1934, it quotes Mussolini as saying: """"We can afford to look with disdain upon these doctrines which are coming from the North. In the South we had Virgil, Cicero, and Augustus before the Germanic Race could either read or write."""" This seems to be a promoting a sort of Mediterraneanism  the superiority of Mediterranean culture and civilization (though not necessarily race, although it might be implied) over the Nordic one. Mediterraneanism is also discussed by Aaron Gillette in his book Racial Theories in Fascist Italy.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

McMartin was one of several cases in the 80's involved in this debate. The best NPOV book on McMartin is Hechler, D. (1988). The Battle and the Backlash: The Child Sexual Abuse War.

In regard to Prometheus Books, it has been stated on another wiki talk page:
""""Prometheus books is not a credible source on child sexual abuse. Their """"Human Sexuality"""" section throughout the 80s and 90s was edited by Vern Bullough, who is also a board member of Paidika, the Dutch pro-paedophile magazine. Under Bullough's editorship, Prometheus published a range of pro-paedopihlia titles, including the Eberles, as well as the book """"Children's sexual encounters with adults"""" in which a number of contributors espoused pro-paedophile views. I am astonished at the inconsistency with which certain Wikipeida editors attribute credibility to different sources on child sexual abuse. The Eberles' history with child pornography is in the public domain and it has been for almost twenty years. Now we find editors claiming that the Eberles (and John Earle, a contributor their book) are considered credible sources, whilst all sources (including major newspapers, magazines and a trial judge) indicating that they are child pornographers are not credible sources.""""

 The McIntosh et al. 2013 study on rotational acceleration and bicycle helmets 

I have restored the reference to this study in the """"Rotational Injury"""" section of the article - someone had removed it and substituted a reference to a another study by McIntosh et al. which deals only with motorcycle helmets. Unfortunately, it seems the publisher has made a mistake and the McIntosh et al. paper and one other paper are missing from the online journal contents (you can see the gap in the page numbers for that issue). The corresponding author is endeavouring to have that corrected, but the paper does exist, I have seen a copy of it. It isn't indexed in PubMed yet either.  In the meantime, I will post of a copy of the abstract from the paper here:
ANDREW S. MCINTOSH, ADRIAN LAI and EDGAR SCHILTER. Bicycle Helmets: Head Impact Dynamics in Helmeted and Unhelmeted Oblique Impact Tests. Traffic Injury Prevention (2013) 14, 501–508. online DOI: 10.1080/15389588.2012.727217. 
Objective: To assess the factors, including helmet use, that contribute to head linear and angular acceleration in bicycle crash simulation tests.
Method: A series of laboratory tests was undertaken using an oblique impact rig. The impact rig included a drop assembly with a Hybrid III head and neck. The head struck a horizontally moving striker plate. Head linear and angular acceleration and striker plate force were measured. The Head Injury Criterion was derived. The following test parameters were varied: drop height to a maximum of 1.5 m, horizontal speed to a maximum of 25 km/h, helmet/no helmet, impact orientation/location, and restraint adjustment. Additional radial impacts were conducted on the same helmet models for comparison purposes. Descriptive statistics were derived and multiple regression was applied to examine the role of each parameter. 
Results: Helmet use was the most significant factor in reducing the magnitude of all outcome variables. Linear acceleration and the Head Injury Criterion were influenced by the drop height, whereas angular acceleration tended to be influenced by the horizontal speed and impact orientation/location. The restraint adjustment influenced the outcome variables, with lower coefficients of variation observed with the tight restraint. 
Conclusions: The study reinforces the benefits of wearing a bicycle helmet in a crash. The study also demonstrates that helmets do not increase angular head acceleration. The study assists in establishing the need for an agreed-upon international oblique helmet test as well as the boundary conditions for oblique helmet testing.

If I created an account it would just be shared by these IPs and if whatever editors use these IPs for vandalism were to be checkusered or whatever, my account by being used on these IPs would probably be accused of being the other guys/gals.  It's a no win.  I can't afford to switch ISP in the current economy.  So, I'm stuck either using whichever 63 range IP I happen to get and which is shared by others who sometimes make good edits and other times don't, or I create an account only to have it get hosed whenever someone wants to charge the IPs with being socks and all.  And for whatever it's worth I am not whatever user who used these IPs in the past gave you a hard time and nor am I whatever other users you guys were trying to accuse me of being.  I am sure not to double vote anywhere or use the IPs to help out in any other kind of area.  63.3.1.130",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde 

You are right, nothing official was said.
But, thinking like this, we would say Arankaru and not Arrancar, right? But we use Arrancar because that's a word.
The same goes to Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde. Adjuchas I can't recall precisely now, but is a kind of monster similar to the illustration we saw when Hitsugaya talked about the Ajuukasu. About Vasto Lorde, as you ar aware, means """"Vast Lord"""" in English.
I choose the spanish romanization because, if it was Vast Lord, the word wouldn't be vastoroode, but vastoroodo.

 Laughable Errors""""The Qur'an also places a dress code upon its followers. For women, it emphasizes modesty. Allah says in the Qur'an, """"And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not to display their adornment (interpreted as the hair and body-shape) except that which ordinarily appears thereof (interpreted as the face and hands) and to draw their headcovers over their chests and not to display their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, . . . ."""" (surat an-Nur verse 31). All those in whose presence a woman is not obliged to practice the dress code are known to be her mahrams. Men have a dress code which is more relaxed: the loins must be covered from knee to waist. The rationale given for these rules is that men and women are not to be viewed as sexual objects.

Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, has laws against these dress codes in schools and work places. After the declaration of the Republic in 1923, as part of revolutions brought by Ataturk, a modern dress code was encouraged. It is against the law to wear a head scarf while attending public school in Turkey, as well as France, where the recently enacted rule caused huge public controversy.""""

 Hannibal 

Good Article it could use a bit of revising but we can worry about that later. Returning to the discussion about the coint,,,uhhh guys Hannibal is Phoenician(Caanite,Yemen Migrents) Caanite(yemen Migrents Berber(yemen Migrents) Carthaginian Arab

Berbers: 

Berbers are the original and first inhabitants of North-Africa, in other words, they are the natives of this part of Africa. The name by which they are called (berbers) comes from the noun """"barbarians"""" (in english). And this, because Romans used to call All those who didn't speak their language  """"barbarians""""... And actually, there are only us who are still called like this ^_~ why did they use this term, they just use this noun without any feeling of a pejorative meaning. But to call themeselves in their language (Tamazight), they use """"imazighen"""": the plural of """"Amazigh"""". 

Many people ask about our origins, and I always say that this question is sensless! it's like asking what is the origins of the Indians! Indians Don't have the same eyes as chinese but they are considered as asians so Just think about us (it's an order!) that We are berbers Thus we are Africans! 

Don't forget that those who first were called africans were berbers, when you study about Rome and byzantine at school, you've probably heard about carthage and africans? these africans were the great Phoenicians,Berbers (arabs). Hence the Carthaginian Arabs. 

But we can answer to which race the berbers belong to, As you know (I'm sure you don't know!^^') there are 3 races in the world: 

The Caucasoid race (Europeans, Jews/hebrews, Arabs ...etc.) 

The Negroid Race. (Blacks) 

The Mongloid Race. (chinese, japanese ...etc.) 

Berbers are predominately Caucasoid (berbers of the sahara are mixed with sub-saharans), Their language is close to the Language spoken by the old egyptians (Pharaohs...), in other words they speak an Afro-asiatic language (Hebrew, Arab, assyrian, Old egyptian, Berber...etc.) SEMETIC! XD 

To see how berbers look like click google 

To know how berber language sounds (through music) download this MP3 by clicking google 

The lands where berbers lived in the past, were from the west of Old Egypt to the Canary-islands, But now, Berbers constitute only 25% of the population in Algeria and 40% in morocco, the berbers of the canary islands (called guanches) are spanish now and they've lost their language.

Berber DNA Tested 

Genetical Studies begin to be done on berbers, Be happy! YIPEEE p 

Here is the Berber DNA compared to other ethnics: 

""""So far, our analyses have allowed a clear dissection of almost all NW African...paternal lineages into several components with distinct historical origins. In this way, the historical origins of the NW African Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 75% NW African Upper Paleolithic (H35, H36, and H38), 13% Neolithic (H58 and H71), 4% historic European gene flow (group IX, H50, H52), and 8% recent sub-Saharan African (H22 and H28)."""" (Bosch et al., Am J Hum Genet, 2001) * * * Caucasoid mtDNA (maternal) sequences, labeled L3E and U6, were detected at frequencies of 96% in Moroccan Berbers, 82% in Algerian Berbers and 78% in non-Berber Moroccans, compared with only 4% in a Senegalese population. (Rando et al., Ann Hum Genet, 1998) * * * 

While the origins of the Sumerians, whose language appears related to no known linguistic family, remain a mystery, the other people of the region were chiefly Semites - Canaanites (the Levant), Amorites (southwestern desert people), Akkadians and Assyrians (Mesopotamia), Arameans, Habiru (Hebrews) and Bedu (Beduin Arabs of the southern desert). The languages of these groups are closely related, and also related more distantly to Hamitic languages, which include ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian.

Throughout the Bronze Age there was a sporadic influx of nomads from Arabia into the area, hostile at first, but soon incorporated into the existing culture. Later, Indo-European peoples migrated into the area. Among them were the Hurrians, who moved from Turkey in the North to Iraq in the 3rd milleneum BCE and brought the light horse-drawn chariot and composite b",0,0,0,0,0,0

The page is already protected. Is this a request for unprotection?  
Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.  
Veriverily only chooses to lodge personal attacks against me as long as he manages to censor any facts that he feels might reflect negatively on the U.S. by means of a page protection. There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.  
Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions."""" (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.  V

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments  

Who am I attacking?  And saying I """"should present more compelling arguments"""" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote, I wasn't voting """"ideologically"""" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.
 

Regardless of who the poll may have """"brought in"""", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to """"bring in"""" opinions from members of the community.

8e5792c728553a62,"Oh dear Rick, we are back your misunderstanding of what probability means.  I am not sure if we are allowed to discus this any more, perhaps it is OK on this page.

Richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability, Bayesian and frequentist.  Although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument.  I am happy to discuss the MHP using either model but let us start with the Bayesian perspective first.

To a Bayesian, probability is a state of knowledge.  That is the definition of what Bayesian probability means.  In the Bayesian model, what is not known does not exist.  That is not something  that I have just made up, I am sure Richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using WP or any good text book.  So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .

If someone at one time asked a question about Jacques Cartier, does that mean we should have a link for him under see also? And remember, this article is not about a RBE. It's about the TZM's advocacy of a RBE. There's a huge difference. Criticism sections should be about TGM and their views. Not about the larger issues they bring up. This is the same as any other page. For instance, a religious organization could have a """"criticism"""" sections and include anything that might potentially fall under the broader discussions relating to religion (which could be a lot of things). Same thing goes for Further Reading. If there's a book or article dealing with TGM, then add them. Adding sources that just talk about RBE or broader social or economic issues is too broad.

Funny, just as I'm develop one of Sarek's very stubs. Such is wikipedia.... Its far more beneficial of course that I am blocked for two entire days when I am in the middle of writing this. Perhaps somebody with some sanity could add the following to the article, or maybe you will take my comments with a pinch of salt and accept good humor.... 

The Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is a professional orchestra based in Rhode Island which performs throughout Southern New England.  Founded in 1944, its current music director (as of July 2009) is Larry Rachleff. Based in East Providence, Rhode Island, its performing home is Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence.

In the 1960s, Erich Kunzel served as its assistant conductor.
As of 2010 the orchestra has attracted the likes of conductor Jahja Ling,  violinists Jennifer Frautschi, Karen Gomyo and David Kim and pianists Ilya Yakushev, Jessie Chang and Jon Kimura Parker to perform with the orchestra. 

Music school
The Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra is the only fully integrated professional orchestra and music school in United States. It has a major music school founded by Alan Fox,  which eduates over 14,000 young people and adults with music lessons of all ability levels and instrumentations with classes and ensembles. The educational program of the school spans not only classical music but extends into pop, jazz, rhythm & blues and advocates youth orchestras and big band ensembles.  The orchestra received a grant to support """"Music After Hours"""", a consortium with the Music School geared towards educating aspiring young musicians grades 3-5 children after hours. This was put into effect in 2001.In September 2008,  the Rhode Island Philharmonic Society established the Carter Center for Music Education and Performance, located Waterman Avenue in East Providence which has over 30 private studios, including  a jazz, rock and blues wing.
Every May, the orchestra puts on 4 education concerts at VMA and groups of musicians perform at schools and community centers throughout the year.

That seems more consistent with the Wikipedia way.

Basically I agree that since there are diverse assessments in various RS on the topic of this article, all statements should be sourced. 
You mention a """"consensus theory"""" that includes Germany along with Italy (1918-1945), which is something with which most people would not disagree. The time frames are relevant to discussions of the left-right political spectrum characterizations, etc. As pointed out in Great_depression#Germany, for example, the Great Depression had a severe impact on the unemployment in the Weimar_republic#Onset_of_the_Great_Depression, facilitating the rise of the National Socialist party, etc.
It would seem evident that monumental disasters like the Great Depression had an effect on the ideology of Fascism and other movements as well. I'm sure that the sources address these issues much more thoroughly than is reflected in our article. For example, the following paragraph cites no sources whatsoever, does not even include a Wikilink to the Weimar Republic article, and seems to be generally lackingThe events of the Great Depression resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies. The most important new fascist regime was Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany, and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised, and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The solution to this is very simple. Find a source which says this isn't genocide. If you can't, then the article can't say that it might not have been genocide. Do you think you're the only person who has ever wanted to write something that can't be supported by WP:RS? I can think of a hundred occassions when it has stopped me contributing something I consider blindingly obvious. But WP:RS is the only way to keep Wikipedia halfway honest.
To address your criticism of the article, I point out that governments, for obvious reasons, are reluctant to issue a direct order to commit genocide even if genocide is their aim. Even Hitler didn't issue a direct order to gas all of the Jews in Europe. That doesn't mean that the Holocaust wasn't genocide. They will also always claim that the genocide was quid pro quo, or an unavoidable part of a war they are committing. The Kosovo war is an excellent example of this.
But many people today seem to think genocide, brutal warfare, terror actions and large massacres are the same thing and can all be called """"genocide"""" when you like. No way. During the Rwanda war, Madeleine Albright famously said that genocide wasn't being committed, but that acts of genocide were. How many massacres make a genocide? You seem to think it is obvious that this episode of massacres did not add up to genocide. But the point at which many massacres become genocide is, tragically, subjective.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

A lot of this coverage is over at Cyclone Nargis.  Sadly, there just isn't a lot of information out there since access to the country is so tightly controlled, and even the assessment teams on the ground probably don't have the information we'd expect to see.  

 Name 

in the article, some parts say Burma, and some say Myanmar.

I think we should calll it Myanmar, since it may not be recognized by many countries, but that is the official (inter)national name.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Please read the tag at the top of the page.  The name is under dispute.  

 Moved the Page Move Protection tag to talk page 

There isn't really a need for the tag to be on the article itself. As was successfully argued regarding the """"dispute tag"""" previously, the tag itself doesn't help the article, and it being on the talk page achieves the same end.  

Having a warning on the front page shows that the article is in a state of flux.  Anyone who isn't particularly wiki-savvy wouldn't realize that there is an ongoing dispute and that the current version may well change in the near future.  The """"non-endorsement"""" of the current name of the article is a reasonable point to make.  I don't particularly care for either name, but making it look stable when it's unclear is kind of misleading to the reader.  

You're not making a lot of sense. The first sentence of the article notes the naming of the country. I believe you were involved with the discussion regarding the """"Dispute"""" tag, and it came to the point where the only sensible solution was to have it on the talk page. The same applies with this tag. It has nothing to do with honesty and I'd be insulted if I didn't assume good faith. Please reconsider your reversion, the last thing I want is an edit war of any sort.  

Look at the discussion on this page regarding the name dispute tag.  I wouldn't say that there was a consensus that removing the tag was the only """"sensible solution"""".
The statement is true and not misleading.  Neither staying nor moving are WP:SNOWBALL.
Protection tags are usually on the front page of the article.  See WP:PROTECT#Other_notes for talk page templates.
The tag deflects mastodons: Having the tag on the article itself sends a clear message to people who might just assume that the name is wrong and move it.
The tag shows that the current name of the article is not a consensus statement: Not having the tag implies to a casual reader that the current name is appropriate (not the current consensus because there is no consensus).
It seems kind of redundant to you or me since we've been staring at it for the last couple of weeks, but to someone who is not already involved it shows that the article is not stable.  I mean, I really don't care that much, but why is it so critical to take it off?    

Because disputes regarding page moves aren't what the user should be reading.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Origin 
The evidence presented by the following paragraph does not convince me of the relation between the Orkhon script and the Rovás. I've heard that conclusion elsewhere, and I'm not necessarily doubting it, but I just don't see proof from the arguments made here:
""""Around 600 AD, the yet illiterate Hungarian tribes moved southwest from their earlier territories to the coastal region of the Eastern Black Sea. The Hungarian Runes are almost certainly related to the Orkhon or Turkic Runic script. 

Says who? 

""""This is supported by the Hungarian tribes' early geography propinquity [Is this supposed to be """"proximity?""""] to the Göktürks.""""

So what? At various times in history they were near Germanic, Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic, and maybe Greek peoples. It doesn't follow, from the evidence presented that the Turkic influence was the source of the writing.

""""Moreover, thirteen of the Hungarian rovás glyphs closely resemble characters of the Orkhon script.

Which ones? I don't count 13 convergences. I see a lot of resemblance in overall appearance between Futhark and Rovás; they seem to show a greater resemblance to each other than with Orkhon. Some prominent features of the Orkhon script are absent in Rovás, e.g. reduplicated characters, and the use of dots or other small characters detached from the main sign.

I'm not arguing that German Runes and Rovás are necessarily closely related; it's just that the evidence presented by this section of this article is hardly convincing. If someone can correct this, please do.  !""",0,0,0,0,0,0

In any case, how is representativeness determined? Your opinion does not suffice. What percentage of the wall is fence and what percent is wall?

Emancipation (1862) was closely tied to growing power of abolitionists as McPherson says:
By the beginning of 1862 the impetus of war had evolved three shifting and overlapping Republican factions on the slavery question. The most dynamic and clearcut faction were the radicals, who accepted the abolitionist argument that emancipation could be achieved by exercise of the belligerent power to confiscate enemy property. On the other wing of the party a smaller number of conservatives hoped for the ultimate demise of bondage but preferred to see this happen by the voluntary action of slave states coupled with colonization abroad of the freed slaves. In the middle were the moderates, led by Lincoln, who shared the radicals' moral aversion to slavery but feared the racial consequences of 
wholesale emancipation. Events during the first half of 1862 pushed 
moderates toward the radical position. One sign of this development was the growing influence of abolitionists. """"Never has there been a time when Abolitionists were as much respected, as at present,"""" rejoiced one of them in December 1861."""" [End quote from page 494  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 excessive quotes from the work of particular authors in this article 

ok. Looking at it from another way, just looking at the footnotes, you have quoted excessively from some sources:
Deitcher, David
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Loran wrote his two article after Lichtenstein's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles, which included the artist's life-sized versions of images from Loran's book.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Portrait of Madame Cézanne and Femme au Chapeau, both of 1962, were among the first paintings in which Lichtenstein based an image directly on a picture by an illustrious predecessor, introducing the theme of art about art. Both are presented at two removes from the original. Cézanne's portrait of his wife is transposed, with significant but subtle alterations, from a diagram book, Cézanne Composition, published a quarter of a century earlier, Lichtenstein was amused by the oversimplified and paradoxical idea that a flat diagram consisting solely of thick black outline could be used to represent the Frenchmen's work, given Cézanne's insistence on eliminating contours from his paintings as incapable of suggesting the corporeal reality of the three-dimensional motif from which he was working.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"The contradictory character of the Pop object was central to an unusually lively and revealing debate late in 1963. It was Lichtenstein's earliest Pop paintings that provoked this controversy which led critic Brian O'Doherty (also an artist, under the name Patric Ireland) to identify completely new class of object: the 'handmade readymade.' Reviewing the artist's second Pop show in the New York Times, O'Doherty labeled him 'one of the worst artists in America.' Nonetheless, he also credited him with creating paintings that 'raised some of the most difficult problems in art.' O'Doherty took note of an argument that had just erupted in the art press: the September issues both of Art News and Artforum had run angry features about Pop art in general and Lichtenstein's work in particular.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"...Erle Loran, who had targeted two paintings by Lichtenstein, Portrait of Mme. Cézanne and Man with Folded Arms (both 1962), in order to excoriate some of the salient features of the new art. Each painting was a characteristically brazen blowup of a diagram from Loran's book Cézanne Composition, then twenty years old.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"Both Loran and O'Doherty thought it absurd that so many supporters of Pop were defending Lichtenstein by insisting that he 'transformed' rather than 'copied' his sources. Claiming that only an expert could discern the difference, O'Doherty found this hairsplitting quite beside the point. After all, it had been possible to classify direct appropriation as art since 1913, when that 'old master of innovation ,' Duchamp had 'started it all by setting up his readymades...and calling them art, leaving on us the burden of proof that they were not.' Both Loran and O'Doherty found the transformation alibi doubly annoying since it clinched the matter of Pop's high-cultural status by resorting to an altogether academic and contradictory dual defense. On one hand, Pop was art because it 'put a frame of consciousness around a major part of American life...we take for granted.' On the other, Pop was art because an artist like Lichtenstein transformed his sources 'like a good artist should'—a clichéd view of fine-art production.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"For Loran, the 'transformation' or 'copy' debate was spurious: since the Abstract Expressionists had ventured 'far beyond the process of transforming nature' to produce paintings that presupposed 'no conscious source but have an identity and imagery that is autonomous,' transformation—even were it detectable in Lichtenstien's art— could only constitute aesthetic regression.""""
(Deitcher, David. """"Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist"""".) """"For different reasons, Lichtenstein himself shunned the transformation defense.""""
Coplans, ed.
(Coplans, ed.) """"The idea of using a closely linked subject matter within a unified style of treatment is obviously suggested in the various paintings deriving from modern masters. Man with Folded Arms and Portrait of Madame Cézanne (both 1962) are quotations of outline diagrams by Erle Loran explaining Cézanne's compositional methods and are similar in the linear black-and-white handling of the imagery.""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

On another point, the article includes a quote of Rawat's supposedly drawn from his first website:

In an article named Journey that he published in his personal website on January 1999, Prem Rawat writes about this apparent contradiction: People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the """"old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes."""" I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, """"You need peace."""" When people said, """"Tell us of the scriptures,"""" I said, """"Look within you."""" When people asked, """"What is your qualification?"""" I said, """"Judge me by what I offer."""" To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same. In that same article Rawat states that people wanted to see him as a figurehead and as a leader but that he does not want to be one or the other, and that all he wanted to do is speak to those who wanted to hear him, and impart the Knowledge to those that sought it. He also said that if people like what is given, to practice it and if not, to leave it.[14]

However, the attribution link takes one to Rawat's current site instead.  If there is no proper attribution here, this passage should be deleted, no?

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

On the other hand, your favored version reads that """"many members"""" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

8eb640ff8a12d653,"Question about guardian angels
According to the wiki article on demonology, there are 133,306,668 demons and the bible says
1/3 of the angels fell from heaven and became demons.  Therefore, this would mean that there
are 266,613,336 good angels (i.e. 133,306,668 + 266,613,336 = 399,920,004 total good and bad
angels with the bad angels being 1/3 of 399,920,004)

Given that there are about 6 billion people on the earth currently, this would mean that
a guardian angel would have to have more than one person he/she/it is responsible for.
I assume that God would not assign someone a demon to be his/her guardian angel, so this
makes the number of possible guardian angels at maximum, 266,613,336.  Since the world
population is now 6,542,502,827 this would mean that each guardian angel would have to
be assigned 24 to 25 people.

Does the above really sound reasonable to you guys?

Also, what did those 266 million guardian angels do when there was less than 266 million
people on the earth? (The world population reached 266 million around the year 1000 or so)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Shouty, accusatory posts just raise the temperature here. 2) There are many, many facts about RC's life we could put here. And many of them would be quite touching, I'm sure. But are they relevant? RC's life is not notable, only her death is. I'm not saying that to be callous, it's just a fact. Background on how she came to be in front of an Israeli bulldozer is essential, hagiographic text dumps about her 5th grade interests are not. As to the point about the wells, I don't deny that's what Corrie thought she was doing. What I'd need to see is proof that the IDF was actually doing that before we put it as a fact in the narrative voice. Also, I don't see where I used the word """"tiniest"""" in regard to theoretical violins. I meant that the presentation of her life was lachrymose, maudlin, and saccharine.

These are always quickly reverted, but I wonder why the offensive images remain in the article's edit history.  For example, somebody inserted a photo of masturbation in today's featured article on Joseph Smith, and it is still visible when you get back that far in the """"compare selected versions.""""  Isn't there a way to just indicate what the vandal did (as is done with the ID of the image), and to remove the actual image itself from the article's history?

Sorry, did Bastun just claim to be an outsider to this article?! Codswallop. Yes, I was sugesting Off2riorob was an outside opinion, since he'd never edited the article before. Are you suggesting that his opinion isn't valid because he posted before you, but if he was asked and he reiterated his previous comments that he'd then become an outside opinion? 

Have you actually read WP:NOTCENSORED? If you have, perhaps you could actually explain which part of it is relevant to your argument. You'll also find you've picked completely the wrong person to try that argument on in relation to this particular article, since I made the pages of El Reg in relation to a previous dispute where I was attempting to include well sourced details of Adams' rather colourful past. Naturally you might not have seen that, but a look in the talk page archives would have shown you the nature of the dispute.

There is no attempt to """"censor"""" this information from Wikipedia, it is currently sat in Gerry Adams Sr. without a problem. However there's no direct relevance to this article, since Adams states he has no recollection of being abused and wasn't aware of it until the 1990s. Why would we write about Gerry Sr. on the Liam Adams article, should it ever be created which I doubt will happen in the near future at least. That would be synthesis of the gravest order, attempting to imply a cause-effect link because one case of abuse and another when nobody has said Liam Adams was a victim of abuse by Gerry Sr. 

It would seem that Bastun is very much swimming against the tide of consensus, having failed to offer any cogent explanation as to exactly how this information is relevant to this particular article he's now making wild accusations of censorship. Tiresome. 303 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Orbit of the Moon 

So apparently there are some sources that describe the Moon's orbit as convex, and some that describe it as concave.  People have a tendency to mix up the terms convex and concave.  Damn whatever idiot decided to use such similar words for such an obscure concept.  Rather than attempt to determine which sources have more authority, I suggest we look at the actual definitions of the words.  All the sources agree that the Moon's orbit has no loops.  And the Wikipedia article Convex and concave polygons seems to imply that a circle without loops would be convex, rather than concave.

Some of the sources describe it as convex/concave inwards vs. convex/concave outwards.  I think that distinction is nonsense.  Something is either convex or concave.  Convexity and concavity have no distinction with respect to inwards or outwards.  When they say that the Moon's orbit is convex """"with respect to the Sun"""" I think they just mean that as opposed to convex with respect to the Earth.

So I still think I'm right on this, and I'm not inclined to change my edit.  Except maybe to link to the article on the definition of convex, to avoid this misunderstanding in the future.  But now that I've expanded on my reasoning, if you still think it contains a mistake, feel free to let me know why. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The problem of LTI is difficult because many BSEEs forget what it is after leaving class. So we have to be very grammatically careful to write clearly for even a technical audience. Memristors are linear when solving a circuit at one point in time, which is an important bit of linearity. Essentially LTI theory developed to describe what Fourier/Laplace transforms and LCR circuits and can do. So it's surprising to an EE that a fundamental passive element would not work in that theory. But it's not important to a non EE. So we have to phrase it such that a non EE will gloss over and an EE stops and says, """"what does that mean again?""""

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1,0,1,0,0,0

I can agree with you on the religion part, but there are also a great many Spanish-speaking and African-American Christians, but I cannot ever recall a Lebanese marrying one of them, unless they were in Latin America of course.  Also, there are also non-Lebanese Arabic peoples who are not of a white appearance, but I still don't see them associating with these groups either.  James Zogby's site explains it all.

There was a stub on this subject that had a short re-written excerpt from my website, so it occurred to me that since there was essentially nothing there, I could perform a service by writing an overview of Ho-Chunk mythology. I had spent three days carefully writing the first three sections of this with an enormous number of footnotes, when some hobbledehoy put in a section extolling the garbage-like ideas of my bitterest academic enemies. Fortunately, only a very small fraction of what I was going to write was entered. I assumed that if this outsider wanted to intrude in the middle of my project, that it would be alright to remove my part of the contribution and give him free rein to do whatever it was that he wanted in pursuing his competing thesis. It makes no sense to me to have a highly scholarly article riddled with severe inconsistencies. That I can't remove my very own contribution is infuriating. 

However, the good news is that my lawyer thinks that I have a good position on this. I took material out of my copy writted website with the thought that at some point I could say, """"reproduced by permission of the author"""". However, I hadn't yet gotten around to that when my article was destroyed by an ignoramus intruder. That means that almost all of it violates my own copy-write. Therefore, under the present circumstances, I not only may withdraw it, but I must withdraw it according to your own rules. I resisted these attempts to force me to surrender my writing to the encyclopedia by every means that I could think of. Except one, of course: a lawsuit for copy-write infringement. 

I'll make you a deal. I'll accept banishment gladly if you will return to me my own writing out of this STUB (!). 

Please contact me by my own email, as this site is pure chaos to me, and I don't think that I will be able to find your response otherwise.

 I Do NOT Appreciate Your Deletionism 

Why did you delete my addition of external links to the article Tiffany Alvord citing some lengthy wikipedia guidelines? There are similar external links on the """"Melissa Joan Hart"""" article. For your information, deletionists like you make the experience of contributing to wikimedia projects worse for everyone, because people feel frustrated and everything. Throughout my time online, I suffered from a lot of abuse, and didn't give up because I had determination and a thick skin, but a Dutch open source woman I talked with, said she would have given up starting from the first difficulty, and we should accomodate for it.

Always remember that “Deletionists delete Wikipedia articles that they consider lame. Chuck Norris deletes deletionists whom he considers lame.” (source (my own)). Don’t get yourself deleted. If you have a problem with something that an article has, then improve it.

Sorry to bother you again on your wikibreak, but it seems that the dispute over the redirection of Chris Conley still has not been resolved. It seems that while I was blocked  has redirected the article. Comments were left in regards to the redirect on the page Saves the Day and another editor has reverted the article, which  has redirected again, citing sockpuppetry and COI (but failing to leave any kind of comment on the relevant discussion pages). As I was blocked from editing, I fail to understand how this could be the case, and a quick WHOIS search shows that the editing IP's come from manchester UK, and somewhere in Australia. So it appears that an edit war is still continuing. Rather than participate further in this and get blocked again, I thought was best to leave you a note here.
FYI, the main reason why I redirected the article in the first place is because Chris Conley is also a successful touring solo artist (a quick google search can confirm this), and hence notable enough to warrent his own article. I also find it interesting that a number of other editors have contributed to the article after I undid the original redirect on July 28 .

It happened so long ago and the situation was SO complex that I think no one really remembers completely correctly what happened.

And between 2000 & 2010 a whole bunch of weird&random; stuff happened that I just don't know how to coherently explain.

look at this sentence, there is a (useless) triple enhancement:

It's great to make reference to the origin of a festival, but this seemed a little overprotective (??!).

Hello,

It's good to hear from you, my tuneful friend.

I am aware of the British custom of holding a commission in a """"home unit"""" while serving with the RFC. I used the term """"transfer"""" because Ball had given up his commission in infantry and carried his commission only in the RFC. Thus he was no longer """"seconded"""". However, he transferred from unit to unit. So, you see, there can be a slight difference between """"seconding"""" and """"transfer"""".

I am trying to bring Albert Ball up to Featured Article status as part of my cleanup effort. At present, I am wrapping up all my WP projects, so that I leave no mess behind. After that I don't know...the assessment rules of the WP game make for a game I feel is not worth playing, and being only a mere writer among all the code monkeys is wearing. And I do have a final draft of a novel to work upon, and the concept of another....

But, as I said, good to hear from you.

  

My point was simply that while one source may say """"transferred"""", and another """"seconded"""" there is in practical terms no real difference between what happened in either case, and hence no need to either edit or revert an edit to switch beween the terms. """"Transfer"""" is possibly the clearest term for modern readers, although original sources generally prefer """"seconded"""" when they talk about transfering between branches of the service rather than specific units. Never heard of anyone """"giving up a commission"""" in the army to join the RFC - it wasn't a separate service until after Ball's death so this just doesn't make sense. Never mind - not as if any of this matters, it was just a thought.
Sorry to hear you are getting WP burnout - happens to us all sooner or later I fear. Good luck with the novel. Is it based on your own service years?

Thanks on improving the NPOV of An Inconvenient Truth
Thanks for rebalancing the NPOV equilibrium of this article.  You have achieved by adding rebuttals within the science section in homeopathic doses what I could not by being I gather too straightforward.  I contributed a huge amount of research that was immediately taken out by MastCell.  I just gave up and placed a NPOV tag on this one-sided article at the time.  The tag lasted no more than 2 hours, as it was promptly removed by ILike2BeAnonymous (who is deemed by Wikipedia to be a saint as he apparently as protected many articles against vandalism).  But, ILike2BeAnonymous removed the NPOV tag without making a single contribution to rebalance the NPOV equilibrium.  I gather he thought my tag amounted to vandalism.  Finally, you courageously stepped in.  As you can see per the Discussion history you must be the third or fourth editor who is taking a rebutting balanced stand towards this article.  Of this group, I congratulate you for being so far the most successful.  

If I may, I would encourage you to do even just a bit more.  An Inconvenient Truth's main message is that because of anthropogenic CO2 emission temperatures will rise by the end of the century leading to a probable (entire) melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps leading to sea level rise of 20 to 40 feet submerging our seashore civilization as we know it.  The slides showing what such a sea level rise looks like (maps of cities, states, countries) are pretty dramatic.  But, they have absolutely no scientific bearing.  The IPCC forecasts a sea level rise ranges from several inches inches to just 3 feet in the worst case scenario.  I think this is a critical balancing point to insert within the science section of the article.  I have tried, and got censored immediately.

On the same subject, I am glad you came across the pretty impressive document """"A Skeptic's Guide to an Inconvenient Truth.""""  It is incredibly well researched and referenced.  By the end, there is hardly a page of the book or slide of the movie that is not effectively rebutted by data based scientific studies.  Keep up the good work. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, I showed you that """"Kievan Rus"""" is used in books more frequently than """"Ancient Rus"""". How is this not """"convincimg""""? Is the counting rigged? You may go check other encyclopedias and come back tell us what you find out.

As to redirects, you are right. No rules prohibit creation of redirects from sensible titles. """"Sensible"""" is pretty much inclusive and a redirect from Ancient Rus is alredy created. The types of redirects that are not allowed would not be created in good faith anyway. Under whatever name you think this may be found in English or whatever name you think the reader  looking for this article might enter into a search string, redirect is always a good idea. What's not allowed are only redirects that are POV pushing through promotion of POV term or non-existing term. Like it's not OK to make Little Russian a redirect to Ukrainian and instead the redirect should be to Little Russia, an article about the etymology and usage of the term. You cannot also invent a term and start pushing it into usage by creating a redirect article under it. Most of the rest is not a problem. Ancient Rus redirect is certainly a good idea.

The Battle of Tulifinny 
The date is December 9, 1864, and the place is Tulifinny Creek. Citadel cadets joined with cadets from their sister academy, the Arsenal in Columbia, to form the Battalion of State Cadets. This was different from the Cadet Company. They had been ordered to protect the Tulifinny trestle of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. The mural depicts the cadets repulsing the attack. North Reference Room

Primary Source listed along with info below:
http://sciway3.net/clark/jasper/towns.htm

""""Before long, firing sounded in Charlestonthe shots that were to blast in pieces this tenurial Southern existence. Grimmer and blacker for the South, the war years rolled slowly on. And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. 
Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. 
Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. 
With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. """"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,"""" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. 
An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, """"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses."""" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 The reasons I dont contribute to Wikipedia anymore 
Reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology.  I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time. I imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a) or e) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance. So thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to wikipedia.

The above user who commented that a user who removed info regarding the punk rock article is absolutely misguided. That user is me. I never once posted that alternative rock did not come from Punk. I suggest that you get your facts straight. What I said was, grunge is not punk. I have been a hard core punk and a neo-punk since 1979. Since the early '90's, I've been involved in trying to revive punk during the grunge period of the 90's decade (while separating ir from influences of grunge). 

I will be blunt and unapologetic again... Punk IS NOT grunge. Never has been and never will be. Obviously from your answer, you do not know anything about punk, its fashion, history, or its influences. Punk is a genre in and of itself. It didn't spring from anything known at the time it was born; it obviously didn't come from disco and it certainly was not influenced by hippy music. I should know, since I have almost 30 years experience as a punk, have conversed with the inner circle of the punk greats, and even made recommendations to them in the early 80's. 

This anti-punk clown therefore clearly does not know what he is talking about. He doesn't know anything even remotely relating to punk. He accused me of stating that punk did not come from alternative music. To correct you, I stated that punk IS NOT grunge. Don't make this same mistake again because it demonstates your low level of knowledge in this area and hugely dents your credibility.

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC). If we link that with the europoid phenotypes with light-colored eyes and hair and pale skin of andronovo south siberians described in the recent article of human genetics 
( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe. 
.
Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, east Afghanistan and north Pakistan) -> examples of such clearly europoid phenotypes in these regions of Asia that matches the description of south Siberian of Bronze age (andronovo culture horizon),

 Squeak, in your add of the BLP, you wrote """"tag for BLP as this article has issues"""". Can you elaborate specifically what some of those issues are (preferably without commentary in in a short, concise, bulleted list)? That way we can together address those concerns. I agree that, per the BLP page, this could fall under its purview to a small extent. My concern would be that someone in the future starts making sweeping changes (read: deletions) based on IDONTLIKEIT with the BLP as their smokescreen justification.

Nonsense. Yes of course there were constitutional amendments in July but those occurred all the time in the previous 45 years, they are hardly a relevant turning point of some sort. When I mentioned constitutional changes I was referring yo the new constitution, which might be taken as a relevant date. And no, the office of prime minister was not """"established"""" in the summer of 1990, it was merely renamed, or I should say the government was renamed, the only change instituted with the amendments was that the """"President of the Executive Council"""" now became the """"President of the Government"""".
That is purely your own judgement. The point of the matter is that democratic amendments were instituted by the Sabor (""""communist functionaries"""") before Mesic came to power. And that his position was not elective, but appointed - by Tudjman.

 The Gamergate Conspiracy 

We have discussed at some length above whether Gamergate should be described as a """"controversy,"""" as we do now, or as a """"movement”, as Gamergate supporters apparently prefer.  The sources clearly have a hard time finding the precise language to use here. So do we. Let’s look at all the options.

A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.

A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.

We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.

“Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.

But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Copyright violation at Sarat Chandra Pandit 

Avoiding copyright problems
Hello, and welcome. Your addition to Sarat Chandra Pandit has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material to Wikipedia without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source if public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to visit me at my talk page .  Thank you. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

8fd9b36b591dbb48,"Specific points of fact

There seem to be two issues of fact in question:

 Which instruments are correctly called ten-string guitars?
 How many resonances are missing from the six-string guitar?

Viktor maintains that the twelve-string guitar is also incorrectly named, which is the issue on which we first crossed swords. I did not at first understand why it was so important to him, but later I discovered that he believes and argues strongly that only Yepes-tuned instruments and some nineteenth-century harp guitars are correctly called ten-string guitars. Obviously, if a twelve-string guitar is validly called that, then for example a baroque guitar might be called a ten-string guitar, and his chance of having non-Yepes-tuned instruments excluded as he wishes is remote. 

So far as Wikipedia is concerned, the main question is this: What should be the scope of the article at ten-string guitar? It seems to me that, under WP:NC, it certainly includes instruments that are built and sold by Ramirez and Bernabe to identical specification to the ones that they built for Yepes, but fitted with a different 7th string (only) to accomodate a different tuning. In fact I would also include any other guitar called a ten-string by its maker, such as the B.C.Rich Bich 10. And if we include that, then where do we draw the line? Wherever that might be, it won't be where Viktor wants it I'm afraid.

So far as resonances go, Viktor has raised this in many other forums. In the ten-string guitar Yahoo! group he was recently asked to list the resonances of the six-string guitar, to clarify what he meant by a similar essay to the one above. He listed nineteen of them!

The point is simply, resonance in this context is not well enough defined to enable us to count them and arrive at a unique answer. Whether we describe the eight missing notes (pitch classes), supplied by four resonant strings, as four resonances or as eight is academic.

Marlow may well be wrong on many other things. We all make mistakes! But this particular issue is a non-issue. Viktor's real problem with Marlow is simply that she is popularising a set of tunings for the Yepes guitar which he does not like.",0,0,0,0,0,0

MAGHASITO 2

USer:Maghasito try to spread of pseudo science, the so-called Hungarian Turanism , which is now a politically motivated chauvinist pseudo-science from the 19th century and a core agenda of far right Jobbik party and ww2 nazi Arrow Cross Party . There are not a single contemporary scholar (academics university professors) linguistics, historian, population geneticist on this planet, who support that fantasy theory. Wikikpedia is a free encyclopedia, however it is not the place of the popularization of pseudo-scientific politically-motivated fantastic nonsenses. The best option would be the permanent ban of Maghasito. Thank you! 

I believe that he is from a worker class family (as most of the Turanist believers), he migrated to UK or USA as a an economic-refugee due to the economic crisis. Many of this turanist boys read the esoteric pseudo-scientific  books of the so-called self-appointed turanist """"shaman-scholars"""". These shaman """"scholars"""" are usually electricians, blacksmiths, masons, car-mechanic in the real life, so they have no any university degrees. These less educated worker-class boys admired them as knowledgeable expert. Just read our discussions in the talkpage of Hungarian turanism: Forexample he consider Ferenc Zajti (shaman-scholar) as one of the greatest historian, Zajti was who invented the theory of Parthian - Hungarian Jesus. (according to Zajti Jesus Christ was not a Jew but a proto-Hungarian). These turan-believer-boys are often racist, they consider the Indo-Europeans and Semitic people and their culture as inferior and subhuman who created a very low primitive culture, and they consider the culture and race of Central Asian nomadic Turkic people as superior culture and race.

The Colgan reference is an alternative medicine supporter. Barrett criticizes alternative medicine. This is not a third-party ref.

 Question about number of edits 

Hello, since the welcome message to my talk page came from you, I presume you're the person I should turn to with any questions.  I notice that every time anyone makes a change in an article, the old and new versions are stored in the history page.  I'm not terribly computer literate, but it seems that that would take up a lot of space, and I presume Wikipedia doesn't have infinite webspace.  If I see an incorrect comma in the third paragraph, a spelling error in the fifth, an incorrect link in the sixth, an incorrect date in the eighth, and unclear wording in the thirteenth, does Wikipedia prefer that I do one big edit so that it will have only one new page to store, or is it okay to save as I go along?  Are the individual versions in the history page deleted after a certain length of time?  I've been editing my user page, and just wonder whether I should leave changes until I have something big to change.

Thanks

 (Butting in here, again, as people ask more interesting questions on Mel's talk page than on mine).  Ann, firstly, diskspace is so incredibly cheap that you could type flat out for your whole life and you wouldn't fill a drive that cost 100 euros;  so don't worry about diskspace.  This issue of what to do in an individual edit is one purely for the convenience of other people who are reading it.  So if you're doing a bunch of fairly trivial tweaks (fixing grammar, spelling, formatting, etc) then do all of those in one go (and give an edit summary like """"various grammar and spelling tweaks"""".  If the article needs tweaks and also need a higher-level change (adding or removing a big chunk of text, fixing some wording that you thing is seriously incorrect or misreading) then do the trivial fixes in one edit, and the other fix in another (with an edit summary like """"removing nonsense about Father Dougal"""").  So (in summary) make changes based on what is a logical unit, not what's convenient for the software.   (talk | contribs) 21:35, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

 Where do these concepts come from? 

The article was recently revised to say that Old Town is """"in Williamson County, near Franklin"""" (no longer """"in"""" Franklin) and that the mound complex """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""" (no longer simply """"on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""").

I'm puzzled by these changes, which aren't sourced. My investigations (call them """"original research"""") using online maps do indicate that Old Town is in northwestern Williamson County, near Franklin, but not inside the current city limits or even in the urban growth boundary. Thus, I think the geographic location is OK, even though sources have placed it """"in"""" Franklin. 

Let me get this straight.  You want to use insulting language about the edits, but then agree that they are factually correct.  Where is the OR?  I disagree that it is OR to state that the location is in Williamson County.  Whether or not it is currently in the current city limits is a factual matter that I am not actually sure about, but in the historic sweep it is correct to say that the location is near Franklin (think of Franklin having been a small town at one time).  It is """"near"""" Franklin, meaning it is not in modern downtown Franklin.  I see no OR.  

However, I can't agree with """"is alongside the Harpeth River on what later became one branch of the Natchez Trace"""". First off, what is later than """"is""""? It appears to me that the mound complex """"is"""" alongside the Harpeth River and """"is"""" on the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace. I surmise that the intent was to say that the site was not on a branch of the Natchez Trace when the mound complex was built, but I don't buy that. First off, the previous version of the article never said that the mound complex was built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace; it merely said that it's there now. Secondly, I'm not aware of any source indicating that the mound complex was not built on the Harpeth River branch of the Trace. Notwithstanding whatever the current version of the [[Natchez Trace[[ article, it's my understanding (based on diverse sources) that the Trace (which is an interconnected collection of trails, not a single trail) existed for centuries before white people laid eyes on Tennessee, and that archaeologists who have investigated Old Town assume that it was located where it is because of the river, the Trace, and the crossing of Brown's Creek. If the intent was to say that the Trace did not exist when the mound complex was built, I see that as a piece of WP:OR that's inconsistent with many sources.   

Those amendments to the article were in 2 edits, the main one with edit summary """"revise about assertion of location, avoiding unnecessary disclosure and avoiding synthesis (e.g. about 2 creeks being the same, not in a source AFAIK). Drop dup cat."""".  Funny you should be making accusations of original research.  I think the wp:OR accusation should apply more strongly to the previous language, which included wp:OR in the form of synthesis (wp:SYNTH?) about which creek is what (and the synthesis ends up disclosing more about location than is necessary).  I think that """"the Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" refers pretty clearly to that branch of the 1800's Natchez Trace, which served as path/roadway for return upstream of persons who had brought rafts or barges down the Mississippi to New Orleans.  The other branch is known as the Ridge Route or something like that and is covered in a different NRHP listing.  These two distinct branches are known in history and described in historical documents, including being described in Williamson County MRA and other documents that Orlady has read.  To refer to the prehistoric mounds having been built along the 1800s-era historic """"Harpeth River branch of the Natchez Trace"""" is wp:OR, wp:SYNTH, ahistorical, sloppy, generally bad, in poor taste, and whatever else sounds negative, more so than the language which replaced the original language.

OR is bad.  OR was removed by the edits.  OR was not introduced by the edits.  Yay!  Glad we are all agreed.  I am sure there are improvements to the language which can be made, but I would prefer not to argue small wording changes until the bigger article structure questions being discussed above are settled.  Or until Orlady agrees to allowing a third party to judge on wording, and replies about participating in mediation to address the long pattern of conflict. ncram """,0,0,0,0,0,0

90207546452dfdc5,"anthropomorphic bias ==

There appears to be some sensitivity with respect to this topic, which I think is due to an anthropomorphic bias.  Dysgenics is a research topic in biology; the anthropological and sociocultural aspects are not central to the topic.  The concerns listed in the heading paragraph belong lower in the text, as they apply only to the aspect of the term relating to homo sapiens.  

(and I want to add)

The concept of dysgenics itself is really only at home in a discussion of genotype.  Direct anthropomorphic considerations (of the sociopolitical aspects outlined in the article) are very crude constructions which do not hew to the precise biological use of the term.  I think one danger is that, by focusing on the easily politicized extension of the term, we risk conflating an important biological concept with indirect sociological constructions.  Next thing you know, biologists innocently researching fruit flies get implicated in fascism, eugenics, and gas chambers.  So I agree that we need to make very careful use of these terms.  These concepts, while connected to a degree, should be covered carefully. 137.186.41.143

Disputing """"Job Guarantee"""" Section
Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

My two main suggestions are to make smaller improvements to the article and to use more than one source. Unless you are very skilled at proper paraphrasing, using a single source greatly increases the risk of close paraphrasing, i.e. improper paraphrasing, and also leads to a very one-sided view of the subject. I've added two reference to the article with links to their pages on Google books (most of which are visible, at least in the UK). The print copies may also be in the Longy library:
Marco, Tomás (1993). Spanish Music in the Twentieth Century. 
Draayer, Suzanne Rhodes (2009). Art Song Composers of Spain: An Encyclopedia
The previous reference I had added—Romero, Justo (2004). Liner Notes: Joaquín Turina (1882–1949): Piano Music, Vol. 1—is also very useful, especially for discussing his musical style and works chronology. I suggest you use these as your sources for further expansion with the biography on joaquinturina.com] as a back-up only.
 
One thing you could do is separate out the last paragraph (beginning with """"His works include..."""") with its own heading Music and expand the commentary there. For example, he was a very noted composer of art song, which is given short shrift in the article. Much has been written about his approach to incorporating Spanish musical idiom in his work and on his style in general, including its strengths and weaknesses. This is also lacking in the article.
 
Another possibility, is to separate out a section at the beginning of biography to Early years where you discuss his family background and his musical education prior to Paris. The material between that section and Music could be entitled Paris and Madrid and can always be expanded in the future.
 
A third possibility is to expand and rationalize the list of works in the article. The current one has three major problems. First, it excludes many of his important works because it relies solely on those scores available at IMSLP. Secondly, it gives no indication of each work's type. Thirdly, it gives no indication of the date of their composition. Listing them alphabetically, is not a good way to go. If you do decide to concentrate on improving the works list, I suggest using List of compositions by Claude Debussy by genre as a model, although in this case, the list would not be a separate article, but rather continue to appear in the Selected works section of Joaquín Turina.

 First.Regarding the above very respectable commentary by the also very respectable editor , I feel I must affix this preliminary response, as for the upcoming weeks I won't be able to build a properly documented reply. You say that I  'unilaterally and without a source named Guevara as an official """"executioner"""".'  Not true, I did supply a reference  from a reliable source (Behind Che Guevara’s mask, the cold executioner Times Online (from The Sunday Times) September 16, 2007) that I later displaced downward. Yes, I am clearly not interested in the consensus of blatant leftist editors who regard Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara as their personal hero, or idol, or totem, who believe he should be thought of as an exemplary human being. If user Nubiatech feels offended by the word 'bullshit', I may also feel offended when he/she childishly calls 'POV' my qualification of mass executioner, which by the way is an historical fact, as many sources prove, and which should be familiar terrain to . With all due respect, when he states that """"...none of the scholarly journals, or major biographies refer to Guevara primarily in such a manner"""", one wonders if he has gone through the immense mass of documentation available, for example, from Cuban exiles? The qualification to use should be mass murderer, which Guevara was, instead of the milder executioner. To display respect or deference toward an overt criminal is not only unjustifiable, it is plain hypocrisy.

 Second, the WP:NPOV guideline states:
 """"Balance
 Neutrality weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the neutral point of view policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner."""", etc. 

 Let's briefly examine what the lead section states about """"El Che"""", to see if all viewoints are represented:
  he was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary,  (sounds respectable enough, perhaps chic, even classy)
 (he was a) politician,                       (respectable enough)
 (he was an) author,                          (sounds very respectable)
 (he was a) physician,                        (very respectable indeed)
 (he was a) military theorist,                (respectable enough)
 (he was a) guerrilla leader.                 (respectable for some)
 It should be obvious that there is no balance at all in the above qualifications; they all depict a character that ought to attract admiration, to say the least, hiding the """"insignificant"""" fact that he was a three-hundred-fold manslayer, even calling POV a reference to it. This is the logical consequence of the diligence with which leftist editors quickly delete anything that might mar their hero's image, and even cry foul (like  above) when anyone doesn't abide by their rules. This user even writes """"POV (not a fact) mentioned with due weight elsewhere on the article"""" in his reverting edit summary. Question: if it already is mentioned elsewhere, why there it's not considered 'POV', while within the lead section it is? The marrow of the discussion is that we are not talking of viewpoints here, we are talking about facts.  
 
 Third. I've been following the WP:Ignore all rules rule, mentioned by  in a prominent location in his user page, toward the objective of having Wikipedia tell the truth, which doesn't appear to be among the most important ones in this Encyclopedia (if it is, I'd appreciate anyone's help to tell me about it).

Alright. First to your analysis. Information darwinism is the opposition to pig-headedness. Bring me the right arguments and I will be convinced - as anyone should be. But failing to do so you cannot convince me. You cannot convince me by begging, threats, bullying, bribing and whatever else you can think of. Only the argument is what counts. What's """"right"""" is not defined by the mainstream opinion. If 2000 years ago, people largely figured slavery was the right thing, or that the earth was flat, or that violent computer games turn people into mass murderers, that doesn't make it anyhow right. The truth is not found by a demoscopic process, but instead, by an organic, darwinistic process that Information darwinism tries to understand and act in accordance with.

I do consider your thoughts on the subject flawed on a deeper level. Part of our problem to communicate is certainly because of the limitations of language. When we use words, and you understand certain words to have a different meaning than how I understand them (e.g. """"Force"""") then we can not engage in a proper dialogue without first sorting out the terminology required. So if you do find that I use a word in a different way than how you would use it, or anything else """"weird"""", request from me a definition of the term. This is purely the linguistic barrier that must be overcome.

Now to some items that I seem to have brushed over:

The data suggest rape victims suffer more psychological trauma than other victims of assault. 

What data? By what standards? Someone beaten into a bloody pulp, robbed, or whatever, may well suffer more severe psychological trauma than someone who is victim to """"rape"""" by lax standards. These are problems rooted in terminology. If you want us to waste literally weeks to figure out the truthfulness of the statement """"rape victims are off worse than regular assault victims"""" then I have to say, no thanks. Because as a categorical statement, I can tell you right away - that is false.

You claim to want rape treated simply as assault in one instance and then go and suggest it should be a special form of assault. (which it is)

It is a (special) form of assault. That does not mean it needs to be treated with different standards than other, specicific (! better terminology?) forms of assault. Assault with a gardening rake is also a special form of assault, that doesn't mean it has to be treated fundamentally different from assault with a pitchfork. Again, terminology appears to be the problem.

Having rape as a separate category of crime allows for special systems to be in place for victims and court systems.

This is not something that I have """"brushed over"""". That is what you appear to be in favor of. I disagree strongly. If someone's victim of a criminal offense, he should not be treated """"specially"""" - that is, not like other victims of criminal offenses. Otherwise you are just asking for rape victims being ridiculed by society / police / legal system while non-sexual assault victims get treated fairly. I claim that only if there is no legal difference between sexual assault and non sexual assault, that sexual assault victims (and perpetrators) can be treated fairly as everyone would wish.

Who do you actually propose giving these weapons to?

How exactly is it my job to decide who should get weapons? I would assume, similiar standards to car ownership and gun ownership should be applied. Both cars and guns are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands - lethal weapons you might say - but both serve an useful purpose: Security and Transportation. I do not think that anyone should be denied the right to own a handgun. And I certainly do not credit a state institution with the rights to decide who gets to own one and who doesnt. But what exactly are you asking me for? Elaborate the legislature of my dreams? I don't see sense in asking me that.

Well, there you have it. Basically all of the issues I have """"brushed over"""" in your mind come down to linguistic issues, terminology and the such. The answers are irrelevant as they can never be given without a ludicrous amount of detail given to the questions. I've known this - This is one of the underlying problems that you have - You fail to identify different uses of terminology and resolve them accordingly. But I would suspect that we have even deeper still disagreements on very many things than just the attitude of resolving conflicts of terminology. This is why I suspect your methodology of thinking is deeply flawed - rather than my own. And that is why I tried to tell you """"You first need to get your shit straight"""" before we can argue on actual subjects like rape legislature and social consequences thereof in a productive manner.

 Removal of beta service pages/notability issues 

Hi Henrik

I have edited the entry on my father, Keith Lawrence who flew in the Battle of Britain in 1940.  He is still alive and I see him every week.  As well as knowing his date of birth and his general life history, I have access to his Pilot's Flying Logbook, giving completely accurate information about his time in RAF - but this is not a published document.   This information and the Logbook are primary sources, which I have used for the Edits I have done.

I have noted several administrative points:

(a)  It says """"This is very much a beta service and may disappear or change at any time"""", presumably because of the low numbers of people viewing the page.
(b) """"The topic of this article may not meet the general notability guideline. Please help to establish notability by adding reliable, secondary sources about the topic. If notability cannot be established, the article is likely to be merged, redirected, or deleted. (August 2011)""""

My questions are: 
1) If I add secondary sources (confirmation of material relating to Keith Lawrence which is in various published books) does that reduce the liklihood of the article being merged, redirected or deleted?  Or might it disappear anyway, because it is a 'beta service'?
2) If I spend time adding references and citations to secondary sources, is there a time limit for doing this, please?  (For example, 6 months from the August 2011 date mentioned above?)

Basically, I would like to know, please, if it is worth me spending time providing secondary sources if the article will be deleted anyway because of the low number of 'hits' the page receives.

Thanks,

That was a real  academic consensus,Paul!Much better than any evidence of a consensus about Pericles!It included(still does) Huston Baker former president of PMLA,and Karla Holloway,who was rewarded for her behavior by a temporary lectureship at Harvard. In fact it included the entire English department with the exception(of course) of the anti-Strat(horrors personal research).
 ::: No, this type of concensus doesn't disturb me or those for whom I write and,I am ever enheartened to find new proof,that such a Marxist view of concensus it isn't intimidating the young.The reasons why William Shakspere is ,in all probability, a fraud are exactly the same type of reasons that Crystal Mangum was raped by thee,five,fifteen or thirty members of the Duke Lacrosse team.Forstarters you can't fit a thosand pounds of flesh(Crystal's minimum figure) into a nineteen forty, two by four,john.
 ::: Nevertheless,the overwhelming concensus of the Duke English faculty,one lone anti-Strat dissenting,is that it did happen.And I see no reason why if the Wickie rules which you invoke are consistently applied,that the Duke Lacrosse Hoax should not be revised accordingly.
 :::Or let's take another example here:Wickie's admirable treatment of the Alger Hiss case,a trial which I have followed, blow by blow, since the 1950's.It states correctly that there is almost a consensus as to Hiss's guilt among the present generation of American historians.(Not I suspect true of British or Eastern bloc historians)

I don't disagree in principle with anything you've written above. I would have no problem with a much stricter notability policy that favored importance over other concerns.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for your compliments. I don't remember much more about Admiral Makarov than what I wrote in the stub. I agree with the need of consistency in transliteration. I think, however, that when some Russian term is already established in English, the established transliteration should take precedence of the letter by letter rule. My impression (not confirmed though a thorough search though) is that Kniaz iz a more common English usage of the Russian word Князь. However, the google counts for kniaz and knyaz are close enough, so my impression is rather subjective. Also, the article you refered me to gives two choices for transliteration of Великий as both Velikiy"""" or Veliky''. The former term seems better to me, but again this is rather subjective.

9086bf3b1c506998,"""I think that, at the level of basic fundamental principles, we may actually be in agreement. I would agree that it's inappropriate for Editor """"A"""" to insert a format that Editor """"A""""  ‘’knows’’ is non-standard,  and then request a consensus before it's overturned by Editor """"B"""" as soon after the posting as is reasonably practicable,” or at least provide some explanation for using this non-standard format. 

We presumably disagree as to whether, in the subject instance, Editor """"A"""" knew, or even suspected, the information (the year of death for the author who had just died that week) which Editor """"A"""" added to the article, was in a non-standard format. So then, if that were the case as to Editor """"A"""", I think then that Editor """"B"""" should obtain a consensus before changing (or deleting in its entirety) the information added by Editor """"A"""" in a format that Editor """"B,"""" acting alone without a consensus, believes in good faith to be a non-standard format. I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor """"A"""" was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.

I believe that a procedure like this is in compliance with “assuming good faith”, which as you know is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia: It is this assumption that (other) editors' edits and comments are made in good faith. [Wikipedia:Assume good faith] that, I think, is what is missing in the approach taken by Editor “B.” That is, that Editor “B” should have approached the work (the newly added/inserted information) of Editor “A” with the assumption that we are all supposed to be operating under at all times, that Editor “A’s” additions/deletions/revisions/etc. were made in good faith, and that being the assumption, it cannot be appropriate for Editor “B” to single-handedly and without a consensus, delete all (or even part) of Editor’s “A” work. Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. 

Isn’t it at the outset basically a 50/50 proposition when an editor goes, to delete the newly added information by another editor, that he may be wrong in making that deletion? And if it’s 50/50, shouldn’t he ask for a consensus before deleting the work of another editor, or at a bare minimum contact the other editor and have some reasonable assurance that Editor """"A"""" has received his note/email/posting/etc. before deleting Editor “’A’s” work?

I might comment that in our situation, it was not an instance of Editor “A” changing something that was already on the page and then Editor “B,” seeing what was obviously an act of vandalism in the changes by editor “A,” reverting those changes. Not at all. Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it. Editor “B” believed that this date information belonged, if anywhere, only on a page devoted to the author himself, and nowhere on a page the subject of which was the author’s work, in this instance, a book.

I do in fact disagree with Editor “B” on that point. I find it very useful to see when, during an author’s lifetime, and also in relation to significant world events, an author or artist wrote or published or created a particular piece of work, Articles about the book, or other work, when discussing the writing and publishing, virtually always includes references to when he wrote the book or when he had it published and even references to when other drafts of the book were created (like Herman Melville losing the first finalized version of Moby Dick at sea and having to re-write the entire book years later, or other such interesting facts, like authors commenting that they would have changed many things in a book if they had written it after a particular event in their lives personal to them (e.g., the death of a beloved father, birth of their own child, marriage, good or bad fortunes, etc.) or events in their lives in which we collectively share in some part (the 9/11 attacks, sinking of the Titanic, WWII, War in Vietnam, the shooting of Ronald Regan/Kennedy/Kennedy/King/VJ day, VE day/man walking on the moon/the falling of the Berlin Wall, or the deaths of Roosevelt’s, Churchhill, Elvis, John Lenon,",0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page.

The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0
908e08ac95b8ab2c,"Question about wikipedia data STORAGE FORMAT 

Hi, let me ask a question. Since I am a little busy and 
I am not English langauge native, my ssentences could be poor.
And I would be glad if you answer my question immediately since I have to leave
a little later. 

When I edited a page, I usually did line break after about 60 or so characters.
You could see how I edit by editing your talk page, this page. As you know,
by the tag < p > of the HTML langauge, the wiki did aggregate the line-broken
sentences into a full paragraph automatically.

I thought that diff is the main block of the storage mechanism of wiki, as
wiki does not have to save all the full page. Wiki needed to save only
diff of the pages. I think so.

Then by making line break as I am doing now, does my method make
the diff data of wiki SMALL? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Diff said that
Some editors find that adding manual line breaks improves the diff function.
In other words, is making many line breaks of a paragraph is more efficient
to reduce the database size of wiki? Thanks. (  )",0,0,0,0,0,0

Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article.

90c08b773033a1fe,""":I don't mean books by the way (which contain hundreds of pages) but any concise bio.  
I looked through several bios on bookrag and none, some of which were pretty lengthy, mentioned Falk. It's off topic and additionally, he doesn't even have an article.  

Well, I'm not sure that Falk needs to be included in the Jordan article or not (though he did seem to have a huge influence on Jordan's career), but in any case, I have written a Wikipedia article for David Falk.  I would appreciate it if others would read it over to see if the article is any good, and secondly to decide if he should be mentioned in the Jordan article (as I look at the Jordan article again, it even says in the second sentence that """"he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation""""... since it was Falk who did the marketing, he probably deserves a link there).  My information for the Falk article came partly from David Halberstan's book Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made, which has about 10 pages on Falk, as well as a ton of online articles I found.  Cheers!   

I added a few brief lines about Falk in the section """"Media figure and business interests.""""  Falk is probably too off-topic to put him in the opening section, but I think he's important enough to mention in a section specifically about Jordan's role as a media figure, since Falk was largely responsible for crafting Jordan's image.  

 Divorce 

Is is just me or does it seem like, unlike an earlier divorce threat five years ago, Michael & Juanita's split seemed to have been kept quiet by most of the media?

I'm wondering because the first I've heard of the current proceedings was last night when I heard something about this being the most expensive celebrity divorce ever?   
Five years ago, he was still in the NBA, so obviously he has a bigger spot light on him. For the most part, Jordan isn't under the lime light anymore, so it doesn't have much coverage.  
It was announced in the press when it happened. But it was one of those things where people stopped talking about it a couple of days later.

Nick Names
I don't believe the Nickname """"Superman"""" is valid in the case of MJ. Yes, he was called Superman, Pippen was called Batman, and Rodman, Rod-man for a brief time. But Superman as a nickname has been used for almost every prominent player in the NBA; i.e. Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and especially Shaq. Nicknames should be identifiable to unique players. If you ask someone who knows nothing about Basketball, what were Jordan's nicknames, they would say Air, or Air Jordan, and throw in the acronym's, M.J. Jordan has had plenty of nicknames, but we don't list every single Nickname, only the most identifiable. That's why his NBA.com Historical Bio, only lists Air Jordan as his nickname. I propose mutual consensus on the issue, before more users begin to add obsessive Wp:fancruft to the article. Feel free to comment.  
Agree, Superman is not a common nickname for him. At all. It gets used all the time for athletes. Unless he gets a Superman tattoo on his arm like Shaq and starts calling himself Superman it's not worth inclusion.

I said clearly """"from their understanding, rightly or wrongly, from verses in the Bible, they arive at the date and believe to be the historical"""" date.   Obviously NOT from anything outside of that, in the way of secular authorities etc.   And yeah, of course YOU (as well as I) are going around in circles, because you keep rowing with one oar, making me do so too in a way.   I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical"""", as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That's not what I meant.    As far as the """"theological reasons"""" the point too is why would they be so """"vested"""" if they didn't believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?    That makes no sense.   It's all TIED IN, was my point.   And also, if it was """"587"""" instead of """"607"""" (according to the whole """"2520 years"""" view, which I know you don't believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we'd still be living in the """"last days"""" anyway.  Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we'd still be in the """"end times"""" if that's the case.    But again, not to digress too much, I was simply answering your question, even though I thought that the discussion was already over.   You were not sure what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical date"""" not just solely """"theological"""".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.  And because of the whole """"Gentile Times"""" thing (as you know of course) for the whole """"Messiah's Kingdom"""" breaking in for the """"end times"""" etc etc.    It's whatever.  I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they """"mis-translated"""" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn't, because seeing other translations they say """"I begin"""" or """"I am beginning"""" it does NOT say what you said of """"already beginning"""".   There's no real difference between the word """"beginning"""" and """"start of"""".    THAT'S THE POINT.     It says """"I am starting off"""".   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God """"already started off"""".   So?    Because in all versions the word """"already"""" is NOT there.   Whether you use the word """"beginning"""" or """"start"""".   Also, I'm a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are """"already beginning"""" or """"first"""" or """"starting off"""".   Because if it's """"already beginning"""" as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say """"I am beginning with you"""" (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?  Also, again, how does your """"already beginning"""" negate the point that Jerusalem would get it first?   Before other nations?     .........""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I agree with your assessment that """"it's hard to learn"""" is the biggest issue with NVC.  There's also no standardized curriculum for it, and the way it's taught is constantly evolving. 

When it comes to criticism, I wish there could be some distinction between criticizing the core ideas of NVC and criticizing Rosenberg's presentation of it. Though I suppose that's a hard distinction for outsiders to make. There are a few things that Rosenberg says that I don't agree with, or ways he says things that are exaggerated, perhaps to try to shock people into seeing things differently in a teaching context  but none of those are the core of NVC, and other trainers including myself present NVC in ways that don't include those elements that are easy to take exception to, yet which still capture all the core ideas.

90e0a235104be6e1,"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing
Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  

More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. 

We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.

Sincerely,

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

Hi Flubeca:

May we find out WHO is doing the article rewrite on the Avro Arrow?

Bill Bzuk, with all due respect, has  a """"pre determined position"""" in his books on the Avro Arrow. 

The  Avro Arrow project was camcelled on purely economic grounds by the then Minister of Defence, Hon. Sir George Pearkes. NO silly conspiracies, or intervention by  Nixon, or aliens, or anyone in between.

Unless the article writer tells the truth about the cancellation, & removes the silly sections ( replicas, conspiracies, etc.etc.) the rewrite will simply be """"inmates running the asylum again"""".

Below is some proposed language for the Ike/McCarthy subhead; I've placed it here because it contains a lot of """"perhaps'es"""", but hopefully it's illumintating.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information.

We are not assessing the truth claims of a religion - we are assessing the historicity of an individual.

 My WP Experience 

Thank you for welcoming me, Materialscientist. After some time here I can tell you that I really admire WP as a joint effort by many to create something constructive. The several weeks I have been here has been an interesting experience. I learned a lot, wandering around the Random articles. I also tried to contribute on issues that I know well. I had my share of learning other people's academic formation and their inner world (psychologies)i.e. how they react to the unknown or suppressed. As a social scientist, I was surprised to see the magnified importance of the behaviour and perception factors. I think I should learn more on social psychology and related behavioural disciplines to apply in my work. To cut a long story short, I think I have been doing my humble contribution to the WP but believe could have done more in this rather short period, should I not faced reactionary attitudes, especially on """"national"""" issues. It is really astonishing to see how people react to editing events that have occurred before our grandfathers were born, if they suspect their world of conceived reality is threatened. Never mind if these words look confusing to you, because they also are for me. I know I simply received a -perhaps automated- welcome message from you and am not expecting an answer to these lines.

 I believe in their Indoaryan Origin (or Iranians of India). 

Certainly from what ive seen, read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and  just North India (not south India); yet i don´t agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people, since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so. We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)

It is precisly the regions of the """"Sindhu River"""" between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of """"Kashmir"""" and """"Punjab"""" the real home of Hinduism and """"indoaryans"""" (indoiranians).

So what i mean, is that if we talk about """"gypsy"""" people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.

That is why many people feel (i am one) that """"roma"""" people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say). 

Precisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).

That is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. M

Many gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.

We must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains. 

The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.

I believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the """"Indoaryan"""" of  orgin worriors of """"iranian origin"""" that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.

Gypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani (Persian)Afghani(Pashtu)-Punjabi-Kashmiri-Rajasthani-Harayana-Brhamman cultures of indoeuropean or irani-scythian-greekish influence and language...

Gypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS, the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania, Hungary and Russia; and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in Country,Rock and Roll-Hippie Music, Fox Trot-Jazz; and ofcourse latin american rythms like: Rumba, Salsa, Bolero, Tango, Peruvian Valse, Tondero, Zamacueca, Charchalera, Milonga etc...

It errant living and the suffering of a worrior people that pridley did not accept the imposition of mongolian or muslim invaders; so they fled with their women and similar tribes of indoaryan origin into the western regions; saddly to know they to large and were not given any help they dedicated themselves to music, entertainment (circus-acrobats-scene players) and poets; yet they mained t",0,0,0,0,0,0

Plus, the talk-page already warns to deprecate """"surname1"""" for """"last1"""" where 3 fewer alias parameters could mean 2x faster for that parameter, perhaps next year. Beyond the complex fast {Fcite} templates, the rapid {cite_quick} runs 10x-12x faster, so """"Assange"""" can drop from 18 to 5-second edit-preview.

Most of the last edit seems to belong to the talk page rather than in the article, so I have moved it so I can be discussed.

Broader context
Use of the term """"psychoanalytic theory"""" implies that there is a core theory which is complete by itself.  This view is not common even among practicing analysts, who in large part recognise that the mind is a function of the brain, so that any full theory of the psyche needs to refer to the brain.  An excellent review of this is Kandel ER (1999) """"Biology and the future of psychoanalysis"""", Am.J.Psychiat 156:505.

Psychoanalytic thinking is inseparably bound also to clinical treatment of patients.  Some purists claim that achieving insight is the only goal of psychoanalysis; but health insurers generally require more concrete goals such as reduced mental illness or increased time at work.  Both of these clinical perspectives assume that the effect on actual patients is important  so they should be included in this article.  An excellent review of the clinical benefits of psychoanalysis is Fonagy, Roth & Higgitt (2005), Bull.Menninger Clinic 69(1):1-58.

This article would not be complete without consideration of substantial attacks on psychoanalysis and its theory, which have reshaped psychiatric practice in the UK and USA over the past 20-30 years.  These attacks can be classified as empirical (Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002); financial (Detre & McDonald 1997); theoretical (Meehl 1998 calculates that there are many psychoanalytical explanations possible for any single clinical problem); and circumstantial (e.g. past failures with respect to homosexuality and childhood abuse, and the antipathy of many analysts to quantitative research:  Gabbard, Gunderson & Fonagy 2002).

Psychoanalytic theorists may have over-reached themselves in attempting to account for all troublesome psychic phenomena.  However, their concerted efforts to address more circumscribed areas have produced widely acknowledged, influential advances in the areas of defense mechanisms, attachment, the unconscious, transference and counter-transference, and the treatment of borderline personalities, among others.  Each of these advances has been accompanied by individual theories.

Suggestions for the peer-review
The article should not require a paragraph to describe what it is about; instead, its scope should simply be theories to do with psychoanalysis.  It should include subsections on the question of whether (and how) psychoanalysis can be studied objectively, whether it is disproveable in whole or part (and whether this matters), the informal """"theory"""" of the manners in which analysis can be conducted (e.g. bare room unlike Freud; methods of interpretation), and the relationships with behavioural, cognitive, and psychiatric theories.  It would be useful to have an explanation of why psychoanalysis has resisted decline so much more successfully in France than in anglophone countries.  Rather than complicated sentences with complicated words, we should be treated to simple descriptions of the differences between Freudian, Jungian, and Adlerian thinking.  Possibly in lists if that helps to simplify the sentences.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The infamous block

Veritas: do not get Wikinoid yet. The policy is on my side: it was a totally unjust block and I am appealing. I still trust Wikipedia. I don't trust so much certain wikipedians and administrators but I have faith that in the end truth, justice and NPOV shall prevail. If not in the ANI, where admins seem to behave like a wolfpack, at least in first instance, in ArbCom. Policy is very clear and Shell Kinney simply broke all rules. 

In my appeal I also ask for Shell to be recused from further cases against me or related to the controversial article due to bias and misuse of admin privileges. 

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-existent races are not my primary interest. I believe though that all this conflict will help to raise awareness about what is going on in that battlefield... (oops! article) and specially about Thulean's wikilawyerist attitude. Besides it may also raise awareness about misuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties.

My mistake. The reason for the dispute should be obvious. The sentence that I removed is indicative of the overall tone of the rest of the article: """"It is best to stay clear of this game and those running it."""" Wikipedia does not give gambling advice to begin with, but the tone issue is much deeper set. A few more examples:
""""the operators...can be dangerous if provoked.""""
""""the man perpetrating the swindle""""
""""if played fairly, which it never is""""
""""players (victims)"""" multiple instances of this
""""nearly all the persons standing around the game work for the operator""""
""""Shills are normally rather easy to spot: they win.""""
""""Amazingly, today, the shell game swindle is still performed on the unwary in larger cities.""""

The whole text needs surgery, not just these examples. Original research means that these alleged facts are not cited to any source, nor could many of them be. What source would you cite, for example, to prove that the game is never played fairly? This article needs to be cleaned up to only state the facts about the shell game, as they can be cited to reliable sources, and in a manner which does not take sides between those who play the game and its proprietors.

The Ottoman census reflects only the religuious adherence of the population and nothing else

Exactly. So what makes you think that using religion as the primary criterion of nationality is not the closest thing to the truth? Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't, but neither you nor me are in position to decide that. This is why in my version all criteria used in the demographies are explained in detail, without deciding which is right and which is wrong, and that my friend is what we call neutrality. You might as well try and take a hint. Nothing from the Turkish cencus proves nor implies that those Greeks were not Greek speaking. The majority of Bulgarian population had never been adherent to the Patriarch of Constantinople. You're confusing yourself with the small Bulgarian or Slavic-speaking population which viewed itself as part of the Roman nation which had lost its mother tongue over time. Therefore despite religion and language, the greater part of the population of Southern Macedonia viewed itself as Greek (or Roman if you prefer). Then if we can't trust any demography, think of the population exchanges. 50,000 Greeks entered Greek Macedonia from Pirin Macedonia, and some 60,000 Bulgarians left for Bulgaria. Then some 500,000 Greeks enter from Turkey and suddenly, we have some 1 million Greeks in Greek Macedonia? Where did the other half million come from? Mars? Oh, I know, it's a Bulgarian """"majority"""" group that the Greek government is still hiding isn't that so? And now think of the ludicrous numbers that you're trying to pass as the truth: 2 million Bulgars in the entire of Macedonia and the assumption of another million in the south. I mean, use your brain for ones and do the maths - have you ever checked what the population of Bulgaria is today? Honestly some people just can't take the truth. And if neither of that convinces you then think of the Greco-Serbian alliance. Would the Serbs have ever agreed with Greece occupying over half of Macedonia for itself unless that land was not primarily Greek? Serbia was significantly stronger than Greece and in the search of Slavic-speaking lands to assimilate. It would have never happened. If you really want to do something to help your country, I would advise you to go over there and offer your people some physical help. I don't think that making nationalist propaganda of the internet is one of their priorities at the moment.

 From Jimbo Wales, paraphrased from this post from September 2003 on the mailing list:
 If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;
 If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;
 If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.

Keep in mind that in determining proper weight we consider a viewpoint's prevalence in reliable sources, not its prevalence among Wikipedia editors.

 Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure]

I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. 
I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. 
I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. 
Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. 
If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. 
So do the wisest, just shut up! 
It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. 
All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. 
Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. 
I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. 
You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. 
As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. 
They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. 
So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.

So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? 
I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. 
Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? 
It is all a lie. 
How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? 
It isnt equality it is power struggle. 
It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. 
WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!

HA HA! 
Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. 
Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". 
For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. 
I speak 9 languages: 
English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!

5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. 
As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 
2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. 
I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. 
That was for learning a foreign language, sister.

Oops, my bad.  Here's the explanation.  When I do a restoration I always upload an unrestored version for documentation purposes.  Normally I upload that to Commons, although with this particular image I accidentally uploaded the unrestored version locally.  So as soon as I realized the mistake I uploaded over at Commons and put a deletion request on the local version.  There's seldom any need for the unrestored version of a featured picture to have a hosting locally.  The restored version got featured, though.  So there's a reason to host it locally: the featured star is useful if anyone considers replacing it at an article (and occasionally editors do accidentally remove featured pictures from their primary articles).

First, I'm not aware of a book dedicated on the topic of 1988 uprising or even the late 1980s up to the 1990 election. A meaningful book on the topic should in part contain information based on interviews with those involved from all sides, not just based on the account of the exiles. Given that the political climate has just recently improved, I'm sure such a meaningful book is yet to be written. Now, I still think that the military will not fare well even in a more balanced light. (No excuse for killing your own people, and shutting down the education system for a decade. Talk about a lost generation. Talk about cutting the nose to spite the face!)

Second, yes, I've heard some in the military wanted a Golkar-style arrangement (i.e. institutionalized role of the military in parliament/politics) but I'm not aware of a formal public proposal. I'm not sure if that proposal ever had the support of the top brass of the military. Then again, I can also see DASSK rejecting such an offer in the 1990s. As much as I admire her personal courage and integrity, I always thought she should have been more flexible. She was never a natural politician like her father who was a pragmatic person and actually got things done. Not sure which National Assembly you mean.

I've noticed that the various links have been removed now. I would agree that if a balance cannot be established, there should be no links to any external sites.

I wish I could find better sites to post, but those two are the only ones I've been able to locate. I did not mean to post a commercial site, and did not think I was posting a commercial site, since none of the sites I posted actually sold any poppers. In rereading your posts, heah, I noted that you thought the sites were commercials for poppers. I would agree that some might consider the second one as such, but the allaboutpoppers.com site is not. If you actually read it, which takes a while due to the huge amount of content, you'll find it's not commercial. It's a research-based site, which gives us lots of valuable information about the history, sociology, and other aspects of the nitrite issue.

 Dumb question? 

Would the repeal of withholding, via Constitutional amendment, apply only to Fed income taxes?  That is to say, would the States be bound to repeal withholding as well, since they are the ones necessarily ratifying it in the first place?

I may have missed it inside the article (which is very good indeed) and if I did I apologize, but it seems to me that once the repeal of withholding becomes an established fact, a great deal of political power passes from the politicians back to the consumer.

 Mother Jones 

I am puzzled why you removed:

 Elliott J. Gorn, Mother Jones: The Most Dangerous Woman in America, 2001, ISBN 0-8090-7094-4

...from the Mother Jones article, describing your action as removing """"biased POV edits."""" Although i'm not familiar with the book, the reference to Mother Jones as """"The Most Dangerous Woman in America"""" was a common one. I believe that her supporters were not offended by such a description; they were working people who felt abused by the economic system, and they relished such a claim. This is not to say that your edit was improper; i'd have to read the book to know more. But if your edit resulted from use of this phrase, and for no other reason, then it was (in my view) mistaken about the general perception of that description. I say this as a strong Mother Jones supporter and fan.

best wishes,

I do not gainsay he was a french soldier during WWI ; I just wanted to add that he was not one of the last """"official"""" French WWI vet  this last point may be important cuz there is not a while that the French government has approved a state funeral for the last """"official one"""" to die... and I think the reader has to be aware of it, that's all. Sincerily.  

 Matt Sanchez 

A request for consensus about what to do about some changes you recently reverted has been posted at Talk:Matt Sanchez.  Thanks,  

 Oldest people 

Hi, I see you've reverted my changes with the comment """"current format has better visual appeal; Wikipedia is not paper"""". I'm trying to understand but all I can make of this is a statement of personal taste, and I'm not convinced. Can we try to compare arguments? To me there are two disadvantages to the old format: 1. it contains duplicate information (the """"To"""" column, saying when someone lost the status of oldest person, is always — necessarily so — equal to the person's day of death); 2. it actually is less appealing to me because the information fills more space and there are many line breaks. It looks more tidy in my version. I'm therefore rather surprised at your change. Thanks for a reply. –  

Please note that if we did the table in 'real-time' and not reconstructed history, we would have people like Charlotte Benkner lose the title when someone older was found, not when they died. Thus, it could technically be different.

Second, I realize it is not absolutely necessary; however, I do think a little redundancy is OK. Visually, if the cases are too close together, then their time with the title looks insignificant. {yakłtalk} 

Did you have to create my user page just in order to respond? (My talk page did exist.) I was going to create it eventually, but in my own tome. How do I get it deleted again now (not just empty but deleted)? Such thoughtlessness really makes me angry. I've copied your comment here and I'm asking you to continue the debate on this page.

I was aware of the theoretical argument you made. You say yourself that it doesn't apply as you it is a retroactive version. Your visual argument I think I understand. Are you saying that with your version each table entry is a two-liner whereas in mine some entries take up one line and some two? –  

PS: I've since found out how to request my user page to be deleted, so I'm no longer looking for guidance on that. –  

Ah, it's worked already. – 

How would I go about finding out..?

So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around.

You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself.

Looking through the archives here, it seems that discussion of the article's name has almost entirely revolved around a suggested move to """"British India"""".  Clearly such a move would be outright wrong.  But that still leaves us with the problem that while """"British Raj"""" does seem to get usage as a name for the territories under the authority of the Governor-General in Council, it's also used as the name for a period (see the article lede at """"History of the British Raj"""" by way of example).  In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.  That's why I think """"Indian Empire"""" is better; it's clearly about a country.  Alternatively, and I say this through slightly gritted teeth, we could have it at """"British Indian Empire"""".

As for usage by historians, surely they most commonly use the simple term """"India""""?  Which is not of course to say that other terms don't get used (especially in book titles).

""""Animation villains""""

The first two have since been kept, but the third one was quickly taken out, but I was alright with that happening, since I assume the person who removed it figured that because he is listed under """"Predacons"""" and """"Vehicons"""", his status as a villain is already there (since both the article for Vehicon and the article for Predacon are listeed under """"Villain groups""""), and so actually listing Megatron as a villain would be completely redundant.

There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category """"Animation villains"""".  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.

It's difficult to tell whether you are being sarcastic or are mistaken. What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.

Regards,
 

It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as """"experimentation"""" what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as """"leet"""" are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?

 

So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.  

OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the """"be bold in editing"""" tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.

4th paragraph
The 4th paragraph is wrong. 

The black body temperature of the Earth is 5.5 °C.[4] Since the Earth reflects about 28% of incoming sunlight[5], in the absence of the greenhouse effect the planet's mean temperature would be far lower - about -18 or -19 °C [6][7] instead of the much higher current mean temperature, about 14 °C.

The black body temperature of the Earth is -18 or -19 °C, not 5.5 °C (which is the temperature of an ideal blackbody the same distance from the Sun as the Earth). It was correct before it was changed on Dec 9,2009. Also, reference [4] does not support that statement. I suggest the following as a possible replacement paragraph and even as a possible first paragraph since it actually defines what Greenhouse Effect really refers to.

If an ideal thermally conductive blackbody was the same distance from the Sun as the Earth, it would have an expected blackbody temperature of 5.3 °C. However, since the Earth reflects about 30%NASA Earth Fact Sheet (or 28%Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry, by Daniel J. Jacob, Princeton University Press, 1999. Chapter 7, """"The Greenhouse Effect"""".) of the incoming sunlight, the planet's actual blackbody temperature is about -18 or -19 °C Solar Radiation and the Earth's Energy BalanceIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Chapter 1: Historical overview of climate change science page 97, about 33°C below the actual surface temperature of about 14 °C or 15 °C.The elusive """"absolute surface air temperature,"""" see GISS discussion The mechanism that produces this difference between the actual temperature and the blackbody temperature is due to the atmosphere and is known as the Greenhouse Effect.

Note that I also modified the expected temperature and albedo based on NASA data. If the values in the current paragraph are used in Stephan's equation, 5.5°C with no reflection is associated with -16.5°C with 28% reflection and -18°C with 30%.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Éamonn McCann on RSF and Political Legacy of 1916 

ÉRSF 'AUTHENTIC CLAIMANTS TO POLITICAL LEGACY OF 1916 RISING' 

WRITING in the Sunday edition of the Derry Journal journalist and author Éamonn McCann said that in his view, as far as Republicanism was concerned, the most authentic claimants to the political legacy of the 1916 Rising were Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Republican Sinn Féin. 

He said: """"The Proclamation didn't promise a fight to achieve the Republic. It proclaimed the Republic as an actually-existing entity. It is for this reason that IRA volunteers ever since have pledged not to strive for the achievement of the Republic but to defend the Republic already achieved. In this perspective, a deal which others might see as a step towards the ultimate objective will be seen as contemptible retreat from the struggle. 

""""In detaching himself from the Provisionals in 1986 because they'd accepted the legitimacy of the Leinster House parliament, Ó Brádaigh stood by the Republic established on Easter Monday. Looked at from this angle - as legitimate an angle as any other - there is no question: Mr Ó Brádaigh and his followers stand alone in true succession to Easter Week. 

""""Those of us who stand rights outside the Republican tradition and who take a socialist view also see Easter Week in the perspective of our own politics, see its enduring legacy in the fact that it was a blow against the most powerful Empire on earth at the time, and regard it as self-evident that its spirit is best represented today in the fight against the imperial power of the US ruling class. 

""""In this view, the most egregious betrayal of 1916 lies not in grudgingly taking seats in a partitionist parliament but in cheerfully breaking bread with George W Bush."""" 

The Sunday Journal also carried an article entitled """"We're the true inheritors of 1916""""' - Derry Republican Sinn Féin"""" on page 4. 

""""Plans by the Irish Government to celebrate the 1916 Easter Rising are hypocritical, a Derry Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) activist has suggested. 

Derry based spokesman for the movement, Richard Walsh says that RSF are the only true inheritors of the historic insurrection and the proclamation of independence. He hit out at the 26-County Administration for """"war-crimes"""" against those who believed in the ideals of the uprising during the Civil War. 

He said: """"There has been much talk of late about the legacy of the Easter Rising of 1916. 

""""Bertie Ahern has announced plans by the 26-County State to commemorate 1916 with a Free State military parade. 

""""Let no-one forget that it was the Free State Army that executed four Republican soldiers in Co. Donegal by firing squad in 1923 as a reprisal for Republican military operations. True Republicans commemorate the Drumboe Martyrs at Eastertide every year. 

""""The Staters were also responsible for many other war-crimes such as the Ballyseedy massacre in Co. Kerry (also in March, 1923), where eight Republican soldiers were killed whilst strapped to a landmine by Free State forces - miraculously leaving one survivor."""" 

He added that the 26-County government cannot claim ownership to the legacy of the Easter Rising. 

""""Those who not only betrayed the All-Ireland Republic - proclaimed in arms at Easter 1916, endorsed by the people of Ireland in 1918, and effectively established by Dáil Éireann in January, 1919 - but also actively waged war against it cannot claim the legacy of 1916. 

""""These people continue to imprison Republicans by using the Special non-jury Court in Dublin - the same building in which Robert Emmet was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered by the English - on the basis of the opinion of the 26-County police [Gardaí]."""" 

He added that the Republican Movement, on the other hand, had """"remained loyal to the Republic of Clarke; Mac Diarmada; Mac Donagh; Pearse; Ceannt; Connolly and Plunkett, and have commemorated the 1916 Rising every year since. 

""""Those who have maintained this continuity are the true inheritors of the noble ideals of 1916.""""  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Bob Ross edits 

What we have here is a failure to communicate.  You stated that certain details pertaining to Bob Ross' life were not pertinent to the article. Specifically, details about his wives.  This information isn't trivial content.  Details about lots of notable individuals' nonnotable spouses permeates Wikipeda unrelentingly.  Properly sourced information about significant events in people's lives, such as marriage, divorce, births/deaths of loved ones, is not the same as saying, """"Bob Ross like cheese,"""" even if one were to find a source for that statement.  Your deletion of this isnormation does, in fact, fly in the face of well-established community-driven consensus.  Examine any biographical article, and you will find lots of information, [presumably] properly sourced, that you, as an apparent deletionist, might find strictly banal and useless.

It should be noted that the details about his wives was very short, noting only their names (obviously their last names were Ross, and unless their maiden names were in a source, one could not publish it) and the durations of their marriages.  Such a short, sourced statement is surely not worth pursuing like this.  Yuor edits were reverted because you did not provide a valid reason for soing so.  As per the widely-held and practiced policy of including any properly sourced information in biographical articles mentioned above, you need to discuss first changes which go against the consensus.  There's always the possibility that you might provide convincing arguments, and even influence consensus-driven policies  but definitely not in this case.  The users who addressed your actions are well-seasoned, and are familiar with the consensus to the point of being able to enforce it on matters presicely like this without needing to query the community.  For you to be able to make the changes you made  as I said  you must discuss it first.

Making changes that violate policy can easily be construed as vandalism  it suggests that you either didn't read or care to abide by the community standards  but that is incorrect.  The policy of vandalism states, in part:Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.It appears to me that you indended to be helpful, as a deletionist, but it flew in the face of established community consensus and policy.  I will remind those editors who made those comments to you about vandalism the specific of policy, but the bottom line is: do not remove properly sourced information from Wikipedia without prior discussion.  This is really not a matter of needing to arbitrate, because this is a matter of content dispute, which whould be discussed on appropriate talk pages. -  talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view demands both stories side by side
That means both the terror terror story and that what actually happened. This also means there is no need to continue the debate about terror, as it is much more important to get the whole secondary explanation on the page.

Wikipedia:Cite_sources
Any material that is challenged and for which no source is provided may be removed by any editor. So we don't need a poll, all we need is to remove a lot of things from the page. It needs to be rewritten having both published versions, the scientific one and the warmongering story.

Here are some references:

[]
Why the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Won't Go Away makes it clear there are 2 mainstream views that should be displayed side by side attributing as much hardcoded quotations as possible. 

[]
We don't believe that 19 hijackers and a few others in a cave in Afghanistan pulled this off acting alone,"""" says Jones. """"We challenge this official conspiracy theory and, by God, we're going to get to the bottom of this.

[]
Around 75 top professors and leading scientists believe the attacks were puppeteered by war mongers in the White House to justify the invasion and the occupation of oil-rich Arab countries.

Unless anyone has a good reason not to add those to the page and not to mention this documented information?

William Rodríguez RICO lawsuit
In October 2004, Rodríguez filed a civil RICO lawsuit directed against George W. Bush, Richard B. Cheney, Donald H. Rumsfeld and others, including a total of 100 defendants, together with Ellen Mariani and lawyer Phil Berg. The government filed a motion to dismiss, or at least transfer, the case on grounds of national security. is worthy of it's own paragraph.

no Osama means no Muslims
[FBI says]: The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 thus the word Muslim may only be quoted at best.

The use of the word terrorist
Similarities between the Reichstag fire and The September 11 Attacks are as striking as those between the Reichstag Fire Decree and the Patriot act there is no need to use the word terrorist to explain the event, I do think a separate paragraph dedicated to the media calling it a Muslim terrorist attack would be appropriate. Wikipedia:Avoid_peacock_terms Let the facts speak for themselves..

Wikipedia:No original research

As long as it's not in a peer review journal kerosene cant melt reinforced steel. 
Structural failure
In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

Which makes this pseudoscience: September_11_attacks#The_attacks: Three buildings in the World Trade Center Complex collapsed due to structural failure on the day of the attack. Because that is not what the structural failure of well designed systems works like in any previous historical event. Here the standards of wikipedia go far beyond those of the mainstream media. The buildings where blown up.

Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words
Avoid phrases such as """"some people say"""" without sources.. 
Hiding all the evidence incriminates the Bush administration. Further evidence of anything is just weasel wording. Hijackers, fires, explosions, demolition all perfectly good to describe the story.

Factual accuracy

There are at least three ways to view these events.  Let """"a=Persecution of Christians by some Jews; A=Institutional persecution of Christians by Jews; let B=Christian persecution of Jews

First, the perspective that we all reject: The Jews persecuted the Christians and this justifies 2000 years of Christian anti-semitism.  This is """"A happened AND A justifies B"""".

Second, the perspective that is, I believe, the mainstream position: Some Jews persecuted the Christians.  Enough so that the Christians viewed this or, at least, cast this as an institutional rejection of Christianity (culminating the hypothesized Council of Jamnia).  The polemic and conflict arising out of this sectarian conflict colored Christian attitudes, policies and behavior towards Jews for the next 2000 years.  This anti-Semitism is rooted in the original conflict between Jews and Christians during the formative years of early Christianity.  However, most people today reject the notion of the events providing any legitimate justification for anti-Semitism.  This is """"A happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

Third, the perspective that some liberal theologians are pushing: The NT account is ahistorical because there is no corroborating evidence outside the New Testament or the writings of the church fathers.  (Note:  Forgive me if I am overstating the position.)  According to this perspective, the persecutions either never happened or were exaggerated by either the NT authors or later interpreters of the NT authors.  For example, it is possible that the incidents in the NT represent isolated incidents and do not represent an institutional policy.  Later events (post Bar Kokhba) may have led to a re-interpretation of the isolated events into a perception of institutional policy.  This is """"A never happened; a happened; A was used to justify B BUT many people argue A does not justify B"""".

I believe that all of these perspectives (yes, even the first one) should be presented in the article.  We should give """"due weight"""" to each perspective citing sources who support each view. 

Finally, I think that we are agreed that we should not say """"Jews persecuted the Christians"""" but rather """"According to the NT, Jews persecuted the Christians"""".  If this formulation were used uniformly throughout the article, would there still be a dispute over factual accuracy?

 Unreliable sources misquotes source 

Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that """"This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"""". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks """"Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented.""""

Yes, if you define """"environmental journal"""" as any journal that ever published an article dealing with environmental issues. Determining this will often involve original research and interpretation.
No, if you go by the inclusion criteria given in the lead of this list: this journal clearly is not """"focused"""" on environmental issues, even though they may be included in the scope.
No, if you go by the journal's homepage, which not even mentions the word """"environmental"""".
So it all depends on how you want to define """"environmental journal"""". Personally, I would define that as a journal dedicated to environmental issues, not just any journal that occasionally also publishes something related. But I also know that David tends to go for the latter, wider definition -)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Explanation 

Hi, I thought I'd explain why the pages keep getting deleted. The long and short is that we're really not quite sure what you are trying to do. The pages are given extremely unwieldy titles that are written like sentences, which makes them an unlikely search term. The pages also didn't assert how Razin was notable. 

I think that you were likely trying to write about Stepan Razin, as he was part of the Solovetsky Monastery Uprising. However I don't see anything on his page to show that he was an artist. You commented somewhere that there were paintings of his on eBay, which makes it unlikely that these two Razins are the same person. It's possible, but extremely unlikely. I think that the Razin that's a painter is probably a far more recent person since a search for """"S Razin"""" (the name that comes up in the eBay auctions) shows that he's from the 21st century, not from the 1600s.

I happen to be from Ontario and in Ontario the Regions are spending many Billions of dollars on public tenders each year inviting only a few friends and keeping all others from getting their work or making money from their work if they get one. The few invited friends are mostly companies who could not compete in open tender and can only get the work from taking non-elected public officials golfing and god knows what else. All that is evident is that public works cost up to 100% or more than it should and they are not subject to Auditor General control. The public money is mostly wasted this way forcing our taxes here to keep escalating out of control. I don't know about other parts of the world, but most honest democratic countries have checks and balances in place. Not in the Regions of Ontario which is basically one big networked secret organization where they are pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars by things like not conducting completive (and no tender at all sometimes) so they can help their friends get high prices for their public works contracts. I picked Peel as examples out because they are the biggest and wasting the most money each year. They have their tender material published on-line and they are quite blatant about what they do, because the elected Regional Council members are almost all totally corrupt beyond redemption.Wiki BADASS Woo 2U """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 2.78 meters per second per second = m/s2 is likely low, but 3.70 is likely a bit high. 0.96 m/s2 is way low, as is 0.0945 for Earth. 0.96g might be correct for Earth's gravity in low Earth orbit, but it is likely a bit less, or it might be Earth's surface g at Earth's equator but likely that is a bit more.

Be careful with that editor

KDesk,
I appreciate your perception that the image of a man smoking a joint (which Mjpresson says exemplifies the title of the article Cannabis smoking) is inappropriate.  You may wish to follow the controversy further on Talk:Cannabis smoking, on the """"discussion"""" page of Wikipedia:WikiProject cannabis, and at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Tokerdesigner banned for one week where User:Tokerdesigner is under consideration for a block because User:Mjpresson proposed the block starting with a false allegation that Tokerdesigner """"threatened"""" Mjpresson.  

At the latter site you may decide to join in and vote to oppose a one-week block against Tokerdesigner especially after going to Mjpresson:Contributions and seeing what that editor has started to do on cannabis-related articles and One-hitter (smoking), seemingly emboldened by the thought that with Tokerdesigner sanctioned, other editors will be intimidated and uneager to try to stop him/her.
